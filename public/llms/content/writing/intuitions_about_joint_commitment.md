summary: In what sense is commitment essential to joint action, and do the
  participants in a joint action themselves perceive commitment as essential?
  Attempts to answer this question have so far been hampered by clashes of
  intuition. Perhaps this is because the intuitions in question have mostly been
  investigated using informal methods only.

# 1. Introduction

In recent decades, philosophers have devoted considerable effort to
investigating the phenomenon (or phenomena) of joint action.^1^ (#fn1) Despite this, significant
disagreement on the basic features of joint action remains: for
instance, on whether joint action essentially involves an irreducibly
joint commitment (for example, Gilbert 2013 versus Bratman 2014); on
whether joint action essentially involves common knowledge (for example,
Bratman 2014 versus Blomberg 2016); on whether joint action essentially
involves a special kind of reasoning (Gold and Sugden 2007; Pacherie
2012), a special kind of mental state (Searle 1990; Gallotti 2011;
Gallotti and Frith 2013); or a special kind of subject (Helm 2008) as
opposed to mental states with plural subjects (Schmid 2009). Here we
focus on the issue about commitment. Our aim is to identify obstacles to
adjudicating among competing theoretical positions and to explore the
prospects for one way of overcoming the obstacles.

What kinds of commitment might be essential to joint action? One kind
of commitment is associated with ordinary individual intention: to
intend to do something arguably involves being committed to doing it.
Whatever kind of commitment is involved here can only be a commitment of
the subject of intention to herself; or at least, it cannot be a
commitment of anyone but the subject and it cannot be a commitment to
anyone other than the subject. One of Gilbert’s groundbreaking
contributions was to focus on a different kind of commitment she labels
‘joint commitment’. This is a commitment whereby ‘each is obligated to
all the others for performance’ (1990, p.8; cf also Gomez-Lavin &
Rachar, 2019, 2021; Roth, 2004; Löhr, 2022). The question we focus on
here is whether joint action essentially involves joint commitment.

Clashing intuitions appear to inform disagreement on this question.
For instance, Gilbert reasons that if joint action essentially involves
joint commitment, then when agents performing joint actions are doing so
in virtue of intentions, these intentions cannot be unilaterally
rescinded. (Several routes to this view are available; see Gilbert 2009;
2013.) To illustrate, Gilbert describes a case:

‘The parties are Ned and Olive, and Olive is speaking: “Our plan was
to hike to the top of the hill. We arrived at the hill and started up.
As he told me later, Ned realized early on that it would be too much for
him to go all the way to the top, and decided that he would only go half
way. Though he no longer had any intention of hiking to the top of the
hill, he had as yet said nothing about this to me, thinking it best to
wait until we were at least half way up before doing so. Before then we
encountered Pam, who asked me how far we intended to go. I said that our
intention was to hike to the top of the hill, as indeed it was”’
(Gilbert 2013, p. 8).

Gilbert reasons that the intuitive correctness of Pam’s statement
supports the view that Ned could not unilaterally rescind their
intention, and that this in turn supports the view that joint action
essentially involves joint commitment. Elaborating on this, Gilbert
further specifies that joint commitments entail obligations; as she puts
it in her seminal (1990) paper: ‘As long as people are out on a walk
together, they will understand that each has an obligation to do what he
or she can to achieve the relevant goal’ (p.6). And more recently:
‘obligations and entitlements—not necessarily moral obligations and
rights—are inherent in acting together’^2^ (#fn2)
(2013, p. 53).

How compelling is Gilbert’s line of thought? Bratman’s reply is
blunt:

‘As I see it, once Ned has changed his mind they no longer have a
shared intention to climb to the top’ (Bratman 2014, p. 117).

How can we account for such stark clashes of intuition? Gilbert is
explicit that her views, like those of many philosophers, are based on
‘informal observation including self-observation’ and her ‘own sense of
the matter’ (Gilbert 2013, pp. 24, 358). It is no surprise that such
methods have not reliably led philosophers with different theoretical
positions (and potentially also different experiences and backgrounds)
to adopt compatible views.

In light of this, it appears that the method of relying on one’s
intuitions presents two obstacles to adjudicating among competing
theoretical positions. First, different researchers may have conflicting
intuitions (as Bratman and Gilbert appear to), or they may have no
stable intuitions at all (as is the case for the current authors). And
second, we cannot be confident that there are no extraneous personal or
cultural factors which are serving as crucial inputs to the procedures.
And yet, before writing off attempts to draw conclusions from intuitions
altogether, we should give arguments from intuitions the best chance of
success. To this end, we can follow the ground-breaking work of
Tollefsen et al (2014) and Gomez-Lavin and Rachar (2019) in moving from
informal observation to a more formal approach, and in considering the
views of a more diverse group of people than the professional
philosophers whose theories are at stake. Gomez-Lavin and Rachar (2019)
offer evidence against the existence of intuitions which, they suggest,
have been used to support Bratman’s view. As they note (p. 117), their
findings do not directly provide support for Gilbert’s view. In a
follow-up study, Gomez-Lavin and Rachar (2021) go further. Their results
suggested that participants in a joint action may feel obliged to notify
joint action partners that they are unilaterally ending participation
but not – pace Gilbert (1990; 2013) – to ask for permission to do so.
However the cogency of this interpretation of their results has been
questioned by Löhr (2022) on methodological grounds. Briefly, Löhr notes
that in asking their participants about a putative obligation to request
permission to disengage, Gomez-Lavin and Rachar ask whether they ‘have
to’ do so; by contrast, in asking about a putative obligation to notify
another of their disengagement, the experiments ask whether they
‘should’ do so (pp. 759-60). Plausibly, this difference in wording could
at least partially explain the differences in responses to those two
questions. For, as Löhr (2022, p. 759) reminds us, it is coherent to
think there are things we should do (voting in a local election,
perhaps) that we do not strictly have to do. It remains an open
question, therefore, whether Gilbert’s intuitions are widely shared
among non-philosophers.

In three pre-registered experiments, we set out to discover how naive
subjects categorise behaviours as involving shared intentions,
commitments and obligations. Would they follow Gilbert in identifying
cases in which there is a joint plan, but individual intentions not to
fulfil the plan, as being like cases in which there is uncontroversially
a shared intention as far as the shared intention, commitment and
obligations go (Experiments 1, 2, & 3)? Or would they diverge from
Gilbert in identifying such cases as more like cases in which there is
uncontroversially no joint plan at all (Experiments 1 & 2)? To test
this, we implemented scenarios spelled out by Gilbert in arguing for her
view, and stuck as closely as possible to Gilbert’s wording in
formulating our questions. By asking participants whether they agreed
with Gilbert that the agents in our test conditions had shared
intentions, commitments and obligations, we were also able to probe
whether participants’ intuitions about the relationships among these
three concepts match Gilbert’s. On Gilbert’s analysis, shared intentions
entail joint commitments as well as obligations, so responses to
questions about these should be highly correlated. On other views, in
contrast, this may not be the case – Bratman (1997; 2014), for example,
denies that shared intentions entail joint commitments or obligations,
though he does acknowledge that they may be commonly associated with
commitments and obligations to others. On other views, in contrast, this
may not be the case – Bratman (1997; 2014), for example, denies that
shared intentions entail commitments or obligations, though he does
acknowledge that they often involve commitments and obligations. It is
arguably also coherent to hold, contrary to both Gilbert and Bratman,
that shared intentions entail commitments but not obligations. This is
why we asked participants about shared intentions, commitments and
obligations.

In sticking as closely as possible to Gilbert’s formulations in
designing our experiments we faced a problem. The formulations are
longer and more complex than would be ideal for a psychological study in
which great weight is placed on ensuring as narrow a focus as possible
on the question of interest while minimising extraneous features,
cognitive demands and possible sources of confusion. For our purposes,
however, it would not have been appropriate to substantially alter
Gilbert’s formulations, given that this would require taking a view on
which features are extraneous, which would likely be controversial. More
importantly, our goal was to test whether the scenarios Gilbert used to
generate intuitions actually do generate the specified intuitions. Of
course if Gilbert’s scenarios do yield replicable effects it would be
important to further support the conclusions drawn with more targeted
stimuli and measures.

A second problem that arises from sticking to Gilbert’s formulations
is that it is possible to interpret her use of terms like ‘intention’,
‘commitment’ and ‘obligation’ as having a specialized technical use. (We
thank an anonymous reviewer for this observation.) It is possible that
non-specialists will understand these terms in a way quite different
from what Gilbert intends. We acknowledge this potential limitation (and
will return to it in the discussion). To partially address this while
avoiding the pitfalls of deviating from Gilbert’s formulations, we
substituted a more colloquial formulation (i.e. ‘We will walk to the top
of the hill.’) in Experiment 2 to replace Gilbert’s technical term
‘intention’.

The question of what people think about joint action has special
significance for Gilbert’s view. It is not simply that support for
Gilbert’s view might be strengthened if non-philosophers turn out to
share her intuitions about joint action. Rather, Gilbert claims that the
agents of a joint action regard themselves as committed and obligated in
virtue of being such: ‘I take it as read here that the account [of joint
action] should be such that the parties to the shared intention will
understand that they have the stated obligations, and that they
understand that this is so as a matter of what a shared intention is’
(2009, p. 175). This means that Gilbert’s theory, as formulated, entails
that ordinary people connect shared intention, commitment and obligation
in the way that she does.

All three experiments were approved by the (EPKEB) United Ethical
Review Board for Research in Psychology, and carried out in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were recruited from
Prolific Academic. There were no geographical restrictions; the
experiment was open to all prolific users over the age of 18. Each
participant received 60 pence for their participation. The

# 2. Experiment 1

In Experiment 1, we manipulated whether participants were considering
a description of joint intention with no complications (Baseline
Condition), a description of joint intention where the participants had
unilaterally and secretly decided they would abort the activity (Test
Condition), or a description involving individual, not joint, intention
(Parallel Condition). We presented three groups of participants
(*N* = 92; 35 female, 28 male, 29 unspecified^3^ (#fn3);
Mean age = 28.8, *SD* = 9.6) with the following three
vignettes:

Baseline Condition: Ned and Olive’s plan was to hike to the top of
the hill. They arrived at the hill and started up.  On the way, they
encountered Pam, who asked how far they intended to go. Olive said, ‘Our
intention is to hike to the top of the hill.’

Test Condition: Ned and Olive’s plan was to hike to the top of the
hill. They arrived at the hill and started up. As he told Olive later,
Ned realized early on that it would be too much for him to go all the
way to the top, and decided that he would only go half way. Though he
no longer had any intention of hiking to the top of the hill, he had as
yet said nothing about this to Olive, thinking it best to wait until he
and Olive were at least half way up before doing so. As it happens,
Olive was in the same position as Ned: she’d also decided that she would
not go all the way to the top of the hill, though she hadn’t yet
broached the subject with Ned. Before either of them got around to
raising this issue, they encountered Pam, who asked Olive how far they
intended to go. Olive said, ‘Our intention is to hike to the top of the
hill.’

Parallel Condition: Olive's plan was to hike to the top of the hill.
She arrived at the hill and started up. As she did so, she saw Ned ahead
of her on the path also hiking towards the top of the hill. At some
point along the way, she realized that it would be too much for her to
go all the way to the top, and decided that she would only go half way.
Along the way she ran into Ned sitting down and taking a break. Just
then Pam also appeared, who asked how far we intended to go. Olive said,
‘Our intention is to hike to the top of the hill.’

All participants were then presented with the following three
questions, each couched in Gilbert’s own terms in order to test her view
as directly as possible:

Shared Intention Question: “To what extent would you agree that
Olive’s statement to Pam at the end was accurate (i.e., ‘Our intention
is to hike to the top of the hill’)?”

Answers were given on a 5-point scale ranging from ‘Strongly
disagree’ to ‘Strongly agree’.

Commitment Question: “To what extent do you think that Ned and Olive
have a commitment to walk to the top of the hill?”

Answers were given on a 5-point scale ranging from ‘Strongly
disagree’ to ‘Strongly agree’.

Obligation Question: “To what extent do you think that Ned and Olive
have an obligation to walk to the top of the hill?”

Answers were given on a 5-point scale ranging from ‘Strongly agree’
to ‘Strongly disagree’.

We take Gilbert’s position to predict that, on each question, answers
in the baseline and test conditions should not differ, but that the test
and parallel conditions should differ; in particular, participants’
answers should be closer to ‘Strongly Agree’ in the test than in the
parallel condition.^4^ (#fn4) This is because, as mentioned above,
Gilbert holds that shared intentions entail both joint commitments and
obligations, so that both joint commitments and obligations are
established at the start of the scenario in the Baseline and Test
Conditions (but not the Parallel Condition); and also that shared
intentions, joint commitments and obligations cannot be unilaterally
rescinded.

# 3. Experiment 2

In Experiment 2, we changed only the wording of the decisive
statement in the vignette ‘Our intention is to hike to the top of the
hill’, replacing it with ‘We will walk to the top of the hill.’ The
reason for this was that talk about intention is relatively uncommon and
may have made the task unnecessarily difficult for our participants. To
illustrate this possibility, we consulted a large collection of English
language corpora (https://www.english-corpora.org/iweb/). The phrase ‘we
will’ occurs roughly 220 times more frequently than ‘our intention’.
While not decisive, this led us to suspect that the more colloquial ‘we
will’ phrasing might reduce any variance due to participants’
uncertainty about intention. This change does not alter the predictions
which derive from Gilbert’s position.

The sample was made up of 91 participants (23 female, 39 male, 29
unspecified; Mean age = 25.1, *SD* = 8.1).

calling ‘joint action’. These include ‘joint action’ (Brooks 1981;

activity’ (Bratman 1997), ‘plural action’ (Schmid 2008), an exercise of
‘joint agency’ (Pacherie 2013) or of ‘small scale shared agency’
(Bratman 2014), ‘intentional joint action’ (Blomberg 2016), ‘collective
intentional behavior’ (which is an exercise of ‘plural agency’) (Ludwig
2016), and ‘collective activity’ (Longworth 2019). We leave open whether
these are all labels for a single thing or whether different researchers
are targeting different things. We use the term ‘joint action’ for the
targets of Gilbert's analysis. We avoid potentially controversial
assumptions about exactly what these targets are because we have
implemented joint action scenarios devised by Gilbert to illustrate her
view.↩︎ (#fnref1)
2. Note that Gilbert is careful to acknowledge that the
obligations in question may not be of a moral nature, and that they may
be outweighed by moral obligations.↩︎ (#fnref2)
3. This high number of unspecified responses was due to
experimenter error – i.e. this question was not administered to these 27
participants.↩︎ (#fnref3)
4. We note that the views of opponents of Gilbert, such as
Bratman, do not generate relevant predictions which are distinct from
these. This is because they may allow that commitments are commonly
associated with joint action even though not essential (see Bratman
2014, pp. 110–1 for discussion) and because our Commitment Question is
formulated in a broad way and does not specify an irreducibly joint
commitment. Despite this, we chose to not formulate the Commitment
Question in terms of an irreducibly joint commitment because we were
concerned that doing so would require terminology that may be unfamiliar
to our participants. Thus the weaker formulation gives us the best
chance of confirming the predictions derived from Gilbert’s position
while admittedly limiting the strength of the conclusions we could draw
from their confirmation.↩︎ (#fnref4)
5. It is worth noting that Michael et al (2016) found a
dissociation between perceived commitment and obligation using implicit
measures. However they did not explicitly contrast parallel with joint
action.↩︎ (#fnref5)
6. Although these authors endorse a stronger conclusion on
the basis of their findings (compare Gomez-Lavin and Rachar 2019,
p. 119: ‘our common intuitions are in line with a general form of the
normativist thesis …’), we are more cautious: first, because their
indicators of normativity appear as strongly present in cases of minimal
interaction as in paradigm joint actions (contra to what we suppose
either Bratman or Gilbert might predict); and second, because their
experiments are not designed to distinguish the normativist thesis from
Bratman’s competing view that norms are merely contingently associated
with acting together.↩︎ (#fnref6)
