<p>Can humans see causal interactions? This paper argues that evidence
on the visual perception of causal interactions, from Michotte to
contemporary work, is best interpreted as showing that we can see some
causal interactions in the same sense that we can hear speech. Causal
perception, like speech perception, is a form of categorical
perception.</p>

<h1 id="sec:introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Which properties and happenings can humans see? It’s fairly
uncontroversial that we can see the shapes of things and their
movements. It’s also reasonably uncontroversial that we can’t see
properties like market value or processes like radioactive decay. People
may sometimes talk about seeing these things, but it seems plausible
that what they strictly and literally see are only characteristic visual
indicators of market value or radioactive decay.</p>
<p>What about simple causal interactions like launchings, burstings,
blockings and supportings—can we see these things? Consider two balls
colliding. What do we see? Do we see only one motion followed by another
or do we see some kind of causal interaction?</p>
<p>David Hume appears to have held that we perceive only one motion
followed by another:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When we consider these objects with the utmost attention, we find
only that one body approaches the other; and that the motion of it
precedes that of the other, but without any sensible interval.”<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Albert Michotte, on the other hand, held that we can see certain
types of causal interaction in the same sense that we can see shape or
movement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There are some cases … in which //p. 271// a causal impression
arises, clear, genuine, and unmistakable, and the idea of cause can be
derived from it by simple abstraction in just the same way as the idea
of shape or movement can be derived from the perception of shape or
movement.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several philosophers and psychologists agree with Michotte that
causal interactions are visible in the same sense that shape and motion
are. Among the philosophers are David Armstrong<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>,
and Peter Strawson who says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In a great boulder rolling down the mountainside and flattening the
wooden hut in its path we see an exemplary instance of force … these
mechanical transactions … are directly observable (or
experienceable).”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The psychologists Brian Scholl and Patrice Tremoulet agree that we
can see causal interactions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“just as the visual system works to recover the physical structure of
the world by inferring properties such as 3-D shape, so too does it work
to recover the causal … structure of the world by inferring properties
such as causality.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While agreeing that we can see some causal interactions, Michotte,
Strawson and Scholl adopt different approaches to thinking about
perception. Scholl is driven by David Marr’s question, “What kind of
information is vision really delivering?”<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
Strawson focuses on descriptions of perceptual content that describe how
the world is presented to the perceiver. And Michotte is concerned with
perception as a source of causal concepts.</p>
<p>The variety of approaches to perception can easily complicate the
task of answering questions about what we can perceive. What could
ensure that, in making claims about what can or can’t be seen, we are
genuinely agreeing with or contradicting others who make similar
sounding claims rather than merely using terms like ‘see’ in ways that
fail to connect with their positions? Michotte, Strawson and Scholl all
hold that we can see causal interactions in the same sense that we can
see shape, whatever sense that is. The appeal to shape perception
ensures genuine agreement despite any differences on the nature of
perception.</p>
<p>In this paper I argue that we can see some causal interactions in the
same sense that we can hear speech, whatever sense that is. I will also
tentatively suggest that speech perception is importantly different from
shape perception. To see the shapes of things is, in a wide range of
naturally occurring conditions if not always, to be aware of those
shapes and in a position to know things about them; but hearing speech
and seeing causings are not so related to awareness of the things
perceived. If so, Michotte, Strawson and Scholl are right that we can
see some causal interactions but wrong that we can do so in the same
sense that we can see shape.</p>
<p>Note that I will only consider visually presented stimuli. Some
researchers hold that we perceive causal interactions through touch or
experiences of agency. These views will not be considered here.
Following common use, I adopt ‘causal perception’ as a label for
whatever perceptual experiences are associated with visual stimuli
involving or standing in for causal interactions. Understood in this
way, our first question is whether the objects of causal perception are
causal interactions or just movements.</p>
<h5 id="i.">I.</h5>
<p>Although we have quite a lot of data on causal perception, the
interpretation of this data is not straightforward.</p>
<p>Let’s take Albert Michotte’s experiments on launching as our starting
point. The launching sequence is illustrated schematically below.<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> When seeing this sequence, most
subjects describe their experiences in causal terms, as the experience
of a collision or launching. They also distinguish this experience from
the experience of seeing one movement followed by another. (The latter
experience is reported when there is a delay between the two movements).
Michotte studied launching in great detail and we will discuss his
findings below.</p>

<p>Peter White and Elizabeth Milne showed subjects various other kinds
of schematic animation (see figure below). They found that subjects
reliably reported seeing pulling, disintegration and bursting.<a

<p>There’s no doubt, then, that people have distinctive experiences for
a range of stimuli which mimic different types of causal interaction,
and that people regularly describe these experiences in causal
terms.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Anscombe,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> Curt Ducasse<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
and Peter Strawson<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> have all observed that there are
also many everyday situations in which its is natural to describe what
we see in causal terms. These include seeing a bird bending a branch by
alighting on it and a boulder crushing a hut as it rolls down a
mountainside. Reading these authors, it may seem tempting to conclude
from what people unreflectively say about their experiences that we can
perceive causal interactions.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>I do not think this conclusion follows. Consider what people say they
see when shown an animation involving simple geometric shapes of the
sort used by Heider and Simmel and illustrated below.<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
Many people report seeing things such as the large triangle intimidating
the small one, or the small triangle defending the little circle as the
big triangle tries to attack it. This suggests that there may be nothing
that people won’t talk about seeing given the right conditions. So if
there is a substantial question about whether we can see some types of
causal interaction, it can’t be correct to answer this question on the
basis of what people say they see.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that people who talk about seeing intimidating or
defending are mistaken or confused, only that our commonsense talk about
perception serves a range of practical interests which probably do not
include, and are in any case not limited to, answering theoretical
questions about the nature of vision. We shouldn’t take what people say
about their perceptions at face value any more than we should take what
they say about the meanings of their utterances at face value.</p>
<p>In cases like intimidating or defending it seems plausible to say
that we see at most visible indicators of these things, not the
interactions themselves. While there may be special phenomenological
effects characteristic of intimidating or defending, it doesn’t follow
that we can see these things happen (and of course Heider and Simmel do
not claim that we can). This is not to say that future research couldn’t
show that subjects really do see intimidating, only that nothing so far
considered supports this conclusion. Now those who follow Hume in
denying that we can perceive causal interactions can say the same thing
about findings like Michotte’s and White and Milne’s. They can admit
that various stimuli give rise to characteristic phenomenology which
many people unreflectively describe in causal terms but deny that we
experience causal interactions.</p>
<p>Some philosophers seem to have missed this point. In Chapter 4 of
<em>Intentionality</em> John Searle objects to an analysis of causation
in terms of regularities on the grounds that it “flies in the face of
our common-sense conviction that we do perceive causal relations all the
time.” Searle may be wrong to suppose that there is any such
common-sense conviction; for reasons just given he’s certainly wrong to
suppose that such a conviction would support a claim about what we
perceive. Searle then notes that “[t]he experience of perceiving one
event following another is really quite different from the experience of
perceiving the second event as caused by the first.”<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
All by itself this observation is unhelpful because something similar is
true of experiences of perceiving intimidating or defending. Searle’s
final point is that “the researches of Michotte and Piaget would seem to
support our common-sense view.”<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> As we’ll see by taking
a closer look at Michotte, this is not exactly straightforward. Michotte
himself acknowledges this. At one point he imagines Hume learning about
his experiments and writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“it is probable that his philosophical position would not have been
affected in the least.”<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short neither Michotte’s nor more recent research (more of which
is considered below) straightforwardly shows that we can see causings.
In order to defend the claim that we can see causal interactions, we
need a way of getting beyond what some people unreflectively say about
their experiences.</p>
<h5 id="ii.">II.</h5>
<p>How can we get past disagreement over merely intuitive descriptions
of visual experiences? By finding something that needs explaining.</p>
<p>Susanna Siegel suggests considering carefully matched pairs of
experiences. For example, she imagines two ways of experiencing a
situation in which a ball lands in a plant pot just before the lights go
out.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> It might seem to you compelling to
suppose that the ball’s landing causes the lights to go out (even though
you would presumably not judge this to be so), or you might experience
the two events as unconnected. Siegel claims that these are two distinct
experiences that the same stimuli can give rise to. Her question is then
what explains the difference between the two experiences. She argues
that the difference is best explained by supposing that the two events
are experienced as causally connected in one case but not the other.</p>
<p>Siegel’s ‘matched pairs’ approach looks promising because it
identifies something that needs explaining, a difference between two
experiences. But can we apply Siegel’s approach to Michotte’s launching
stimulus? There would have to be a pair of occasions on which a subject
saw the same type of launching sequence, experiencing successive
movements on one occasion and experiencing launching on the other.
Unfortunately, it seems there are no such pairs because, in the case of
launching and similar stimuli, the characteristic phenomenology
described as causal appears to be mandatory if you’re paying attention.
So we cannot apply Siegel’s approach here.</p>
<p>This problem relates to a defect of Siegel’s approach: it does not
distinguish perceptual phenomenology from the non-perceptual
phenomenology associated with the feeling of being struck by an idea.
When a ball drops just as a light goes out, are we struck by the thought
that one caused the other or do we somehow perceive this? Siegel’s
approach does not distinguish these two possibilities, which undermines
her claim to have shown that “causation is represented in visual
experience.”<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> When Michotte discusses the sort of
cases Siegel focuses on, he denies that causation is perceived but notes
that “a causal interpretation is urgently called for.”<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
This seems at least as plausible as Siegel’s claim that we perceive a
causal interaction when a ball lands in a plant pot just before the
lights go out. Indeed, it is tempting to think that genuinely perceptual
phenomenology is always mandatory for subjects attending to the relevant
aspects of stimuli. If so, the only phenomenological effects Siegel’s
‘matched pairs’ approach can discern are non-perceptual because the
required pairs of experiences do not exist when the phenomenology is
mandatory.</p>
<p>Our aim is to support the claim that some causal interactions can be
seen by finding something that needs explaining.</p>
<p>Brian Scholl and Ken Nakayama offer a promising candidate that needs
explaining: illusory causal crescents. Consider a display just like
Michotte’s launching stimulus except that the two objects completely
overlap before the second starts to move (see left half of the figure
below).<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> In this case almost all subjects
report seeing a single object moving in front of or behind a stationary
object; some report that the moving object changes colour.<a
href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> However, it is possible to enhance
this display to induce subjects to report seeing the overlap event as a
launching event rather than as the movement of a single object (see
right half of the figure below).<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> And here’s the fact to
be explained: when subjects report seeing the overlap event as
launching, they also report seeing an illusory crescent as if the shapes
did not completely overlap and they systematically underestimate the
degree of overlap between the two objects.<a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"

</table>
<p>Does explaining this fact require appeal to the claim that we can see
some types of causal interaction? Let’s allow, as Scholl and Nakayama
claim, that subjects are seeing illusory causal crescents and that the
experience characteristic of launching affects the perception of
shape.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> Given this, Scholl and Nakayama
offer ‘a simple categorical explanation for the Causal Crescents
illusion’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the visual system, when led by other means to perceive an event as a
causal collision, effectively ‘refuses’ to see the two objects as fully
overlapped, because of an internalized constraint to the effect that
such a spatial arrangement is not physically possible. As a result, a
thin crescent of one object remains uncovered by the other one—as would
in fact be the case in a straight-on billiard-ball collision.”<a
href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this is the best explanation of the illusory causal crescents,
then we can indeed see at least one type of causal interaction.</p>
<p>This argument appears to be a promising way of attacking the idea
that the experience characteristic of launching involves only some
special phenomenological effect indicative of collisions. After all, why
would such a phenomenological effect be associated with the illusory
perception of crescents? Scholl and Nakayama’s position is well
supported insofar as explaining the association between seeing
launchings and seeing crescents requires appeal to some state with
causal content.</p>
<p>But must that state be perceptual? On the face of it, Scholl and
Nakayama’s finding is equally well explained by either of two
hypotheses: (a) there is a visual perception of a collision; or (b)
there is some non-doxastic but also non-perceptual cognition of a
collision. Since there may well be ways to exclude (b), I do not claim
that Scholl and Nakayama’s argument is incorrect. But I cannot make use
of this argument here without ruling out (b) and that would seem to
require understanding how perception is distinct from and relates to
other forms of cognition. Also, Scholl and Nakayama’s strategy may not
generalise to cases other than the launching stimuli. We would ideally
like to be able to say more generally which types of causal interactions
can be perceived rather than just that at least one type is perceived
(for examples see White and Milne’s stimuli above). For these reasons I
want to introduce and then pursue a third and final approach to showing
that we can see some types of causal interaction. (The illusory causal
crescents finding will be useful later.)</p>
<p>Michotte’s work provides the most promising candidate for a fact in
need of explanation. The first phase of Michotte’s work involves
discovering the precise conditions under which the launching effect
occurs, such as the relative speeds of the two objects, the delay
between the first and second objects’ movements, and the trajectories of
the two objects. For instance, consider what happens if there is a pause
between the first object’s movement and the second object’s movement.
How long can the pause be before the launching effect vanishes?
Michotte’s findings are presented in this table:</p>

</table>
<p>Contemporary philosophers and psychologists sometimes write as if all
Michotte did was study, in minute detail, the conditions under which the
launching effect occurs. But this is to ignore the crucial second phase
of Michotte’s work. He wasn’t directly concerned to know that pauses
longer than 70ms dramatically reduce the impression of launching. His
question was <em>why</em> the launching impression occurs under
precisely these conditions and not others. He writes that after
identifying conditions under which the launching effect occurs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“we were confronted with a second task, that of ‘understanding’ the
phenomenon, of … seeking to find out why such and such conditions were
necessary for its production, and why it possessed such and such
properties.”<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Michotte’s idea, then, is that we can get past superficial ideas
about the perceptual experiences characteristic of launching by first
(a) identifying the precise conditions under which these experiences
occur and then (b) explaining <em>why</em> they occur under these
conditions. If it turns out that the best explanation at stage (b)
requires the claim that we see causal interactions, then we will have an
argument for that claim.</p>
<p>The key fact to be explained, then, is that the experience
characteristic of launching occurs under certain conditions. Having come
this far with Michotte, I now want to deviate from his views. To develop
the argument that we can see causal interactions, we need to compare
causal with speech perception.</p>
<h5 id="iii.">III.</h5>
<p>One of the questions set for this volume is: What methods can we use
to determine the admissible contents of experience? One way to answer
this question is to study cases where researchers have been successful,
and speech is one of those cases.</p>
<p>According to Alvin Liberman and Ignatius Mattingly’s “motor theory”
of speech perception, when we encounter speech we perceive not sounds
but gestures. More exactly, we perceive “the intended<a href="#fn32"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>
phonic gestures of the speaker.”</p>
<p>In the case of causation our question is, Do we perceive merely a
sequence of movements or do we perceive causal interactions? In the case
of speech, a parallel question is, Do we perceive sounds or intended
phonic gestures?</p>
<p>Naturally not everyone accepts the motor theory of speech
perception.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> For our purposes, it is most
important that Liberman and Mattingly have a valid argument for the
conclusion that the objects of speech perception are intended gestures;
whether the premises of this argument are true is less important. After
all, even if their claims about speech were false, parallel claims might
be true of causal perception.</p>
<p>Liberman and Mattingly’s argument starts from the premise that speech
perception is categorical. To illustrate, consider the following
representation of twelve sounds:</p>

</table>
<p>Each sound differs from its neighbours by the same amount as any
other sound, at least when difference is measured by frequency. Most
people would not be able to discriminate two adjacent sounds, except for
two special cases (one around -3 to -1 and one around +1 to +3) where
the discrimination is easier; here people hear the sound change from da
to ga or from ga to ba. This pattern of heightened discrimination is the
defining characteristic of categorical perception.<a href="#fn34"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>
Small changes to stimuli can make large differences to perception, large
changes to stimuli can make small differences to perception, and the
stimuli can be ordered and sorted into categories such that
discriminating nearby pairs of stimuli on either side of a category
boundary is dramatically easier than discriminating pairs from within a
category.</p>
<p>The existence of these category boundaries is specific to speech
perception as opposed to auditory perception generally. When special
tricks are used to make subjects perceive a stimulus first as speech and
then as non-speech, the locations of boundaries differ between the two
types of perception.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>Speech perception also exhibits constancy (otherwise called
invariance): the location of the category boundaries changes depending
on contextual factors such as the speaker’s dialect<a href="#fn36"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
or the rate at which the speaker talks<a href="#fn37"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>;
both factors dramatically affect which sounds are produced. This means
that between two different contexts, different stimuli may result in the
same perceptions and the same stimulus may result in different
perceptions.<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Later I will defend a distinction between categorical and other forms
of perception. It’s essential for drawing this distinction that I have
characterised categorical perception in terms of abilities to
distinguish stimuli and not in terms of how stimuli appear to
perceivers. For example, I have not talked about pairs of colours or
sounds being perceived as similar. In my view, which I take to be the
standard view,<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> categorical perception is not a
matter of how things appear at all. <a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>Given that speech perception is categorical and exhibits constancy,
we can ask where the category boundaries fall. Which features of the
stimuli best predict category membership? Liberman and Mattingly show
that, in the case of speech, category boundaries typically correspond to
differences between intended phonic gestures. The existence of category
boundaries and their correspondence to intended phonic gestures needs
explaining.</p>
<p>Following Liberman and Mattingly, we can explain this by postulating
a module for speech perception. Anything which is potentially speech
(including both auditory and visual stimuli) is passed to the module
which attempts to interpret it as speech. It does this by attempting to
replicate stimuli by issuing the same gestures that are also used for
producing speech (this is the ‘motor’ in ‘motor theory’). Where a
replication is possible, the stimuli are perceived as speech, further
auditory or visual processing is partially suppressed, and the module
identifies the stimuli as composed of the gestures that were used in the
successful replication. Accordingly we can say that the stimuli are
perceived as a sequence of phonic gestures.</p>
<p>One line of response to this argument involves attempting to show
that the category boundaries correspond to some acoustic property of
speech at least as well as to intended phonic gestures.<a href="#fn41"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a>
If such a correspondence were found, it might be possible to give a
explanation better than Liberman and Mattingly’s for the existence of
categories corresponding to intended phonic gestures. Reasons for
doubting any such explanation exists include the constancy effects
already mentioned and also coarticulation, the fact that phonic gestures
overlap (this is what makes talking fast).</p>
<p>In outline Liberman and Mattingly’s argument for the claim that the
objects of speech perception are intended phonic gestures has this
form:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) There are category boundaries … .</p>
<p>(2) … which correspond to intended phonic gestures</p>
<p>(3) Facts (1) and (2) stand in need of explanation.</p>
<p>(4) The best explanation of (1) and (2) involves the claim that the
objects of speech perception are intended phonic gestures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This illustrates how we might establish claims about the objects of
perception without relying too directly on what people say they perceive
and without presupposing very general theoretical claims about what it
means for something to be perceived.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting we can take the case of speech perception as a
model for understanding perception generally. In my view speech
perception, like other forms of categorical perception, is importantly
different from ordinary, non-categorical perception. By contrast, some
philosophers have developed general accounts of perception which appear
to be supported primarily by cases of categorical perception such as
speech and colour. For instance, both Fred Dretske and Jerry Fodor have
taken speech perception as a paradigm case for very general theories
about what it is for something to be an object of perception.<a
href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> Mohan Matthen has recently gone
even further by supposing that all perception is a matter of assigning
stimuli to categories.<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> For reasons tentatively outlined
later, these authors may be mistaken to take categorical forms of
perception as paradigm cases of perception generally. The suggestion I
develop next is only that the categorical perception of speech is a
reasonable model for causal perception of visual stimuli.</p>
<h5 id="iv.">IV.</h5>
<p>Is speech perception a good model for causal perception? I want to
suggest that it is, and that we can use an argument like (1)–(4) above
to show that we perceive causal interactions.</p>
<p>The first step is to show that causal perception exhibits the key
features of categorical perception. As already mentioned, whether or not
the experience characteristic of launching occurs depends on
interactions among various factors including the relative speeds of the
two objects, the delay between the first and second objects’ movements,
and the trajectories of the two objects. Importantly, the difference
between an experience characteristic of launching and an experience of
two distinct motions often depends on small changes to
parameters—changes which are smaller than can normally be discerned in
perception. For instance, consider trials in which there is a short
pause between the movements of two objects, A and B. When two trials
differ only in that the gap is 28ms longer on one of the trials, most
observers probably could not tell the trials apart, except in the
special case where 28ms makes the difference between the experience
characteristic of launching and the experience characteristic of two
movements (see figure below). As in the case of speech, then, there are
points around which exceptionally fine-grained discriminations are
possible. This is the key indicator that causal perception is
categorical.</p>

<p>As well as such things as relative trajectories and speeds, the
experience of launching also depends on high-level features of stimuli.
For example, Michotte found that if the second ball in a launching
sequence is initially seen moving backwards and forwards on its own
account, then the experience distinctive of launching does not occur.<a
href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> So the experience characteristic of
launching depends not only on simple spatial and temporal parameters but
also on more complicated structural features of the stimuli.<a
href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> Scholl and colleagues have shown,
further, that in some situations the experience characteristic of
launching depends how events unfold shortly after the moment of
collision.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> This suggests that the relation
between experiences and visual stimuli is complex in the same way as the
relation between speech experiences and speech stimuli: in both cases
there is no simple mapping from features of the stimuli to features of
the experience unless one characterises the stimuli in terms of gestures
or causes.</p>
<p>In short, the experience characteristic of launching involves both
the heightened discriminability and the sensitivity to complex features
of stimuli that are characteristic of categorical perception. Research
on other causal stimuli such as pulling and bursting is less well
developed but also provides some evidence that causal perception may be
a form of categorical perception.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>To say that perceptual experiences characteristic of launching and
other causal stimuli are categorical is not yet to say where the
category boundaries fall. The experimental findings appealed to so far
rely on what subjects say about their experiences only as a way of
distinguishing whether on two occasions they have the same or different
types of experience. At this point, what the experiences are experiences
of is an open question.</p>
<p>We can take a first step to answering this question by finding things
the categories correspond to—that is, by inquiring which features of
stimuli reliably predict whether they will be assigned to a given
perceptual category. Of course this is only a first step. Facts about
what perceptual categories correspond to do not straightforwardly
determine what those categories are categories of.</p>
<p>Michotte argued that the conditions under which the experience
characteristic of launching occurs correspond to physical laws governing
collisions.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> In fact, Michotte thought the
correspondence so close that at one point he even suggests it would be
possible to learn about the physics of collisions by studying their
perception:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“anyone not very familiar with the procedure involved in framing the
physical concepts of inertia, energy, conservation of energy, etc.,
might think that these concepts are simply derived from the data of
immediate experience.”<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opposing Michotte, Peter White and Elizabeth Milne suggest that the
conditions under which the perceptions occur do not correspond to
conditions required for actual pulling or bursting. Rather, they suggest
that they may correspond to laws implicit in our naive conceptions of
causal interactions.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Evaluating these hypotheses requires painstaking empirical research
on category boundaries (just as in the case of speech). To illustrate,
consider Michotte’s finding that the experience of launching occurs when
there is a pause between two objects’ movements of around 80ms or less.
How is this consistent with the laws of mechanics—surely no pause can be
tolerated? Ingeniously, Michotte compares launching with the movement of
a single object. The single object moves half way across a screen then
pauses before continuing to move. Michotte found that the longest pause
between the two movements consistent with subjects experiencing them as
a single movement is around 80ms, exactly the longest pause consistent
with experiences characteristic of launching.<a href="#fn52"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a>
Accordingly, the experience characteristic of launching appears to
require that the two movements be experienced as uninterrupted—this is
why they can be separated by a pause of up to but no longer than
80ms.</p>
<p>This is the kind of detailed investigation needed to support (or
refute) claims that conditions for experiences characteristic of
launching correspond to conditions for a certain kind of collision. Such
research may eventually enable us to make fine-grained distinctions
between competing hypotheses about which causal interactions are
perceived and how they are perceived. As things stand it is already
reasonable to conclude that there is some correspondence between the
conditions under which experiences characteristic of various types of
causal interaction occur and conditions under which the causal
interactions themselves occur.</p>
<p>This needs qualification because few of the stimuli used in
experiments on causal perception involve real causal interactions.
Strictly speaking we need to hedge the claim that conditions for
experiences characteristic of launching correspond to conditions under
which collisions occur by restricting it to the perceiver’s natural
environment and excluding factors to which the relevant perceptual
systems are insensitive.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> In case this hedge
seems like a fudge, note that exactly the same considerations apply in
the case of speech. Earlier I mentioned that category boundaries in
speech perception correspond to differences in intended phonic gesture.
But as speech perception is reliably fooled into treating all kinds of
synthetic sounds as speech, this is not strictly true. As in the causal
case, it is at best true taking into account the limits of perceptual
systems, their natural environments and the types of information they
are concerned with processing.</p>
<p>If a simple covariational or causal theory of perceptual content were
correct, the need to hedge claims about correspondence would show that
we do not perceive causal interactions (and that we do not perceive
intended phonic gestures). I am assuming that such theories are false
and appealing to correspondence not as a necessary or sufficient
condition on perception but only as something to be explained. Given
this, hedging would only be objectionable if done to such an extent that
the correspondence in question were no longer a fact that needs
explaining. After all, even imperfect correspondences need explanation
(for example, a correspondence between weather forecasts and actual
weather conditions).</p>
<p>So far, then, we have covered the first three steps of an argument
parallel to the one about speech:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1') There are category boundaries …</p>
<p>(2') … which correspond to certain types of causal interaction.</p>
<p>(3') Facts (1') &amp; (2') need explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brings us to the fourth and final step of the argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(4') The best explanation of (1') &amp; (2') involves the claim that
the objects of perception are causal interactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In defence of (4'), I conjecture that the perceptual experiences
characteristic of causal interactions are best explained as by-products
of perceptual mechanisms whose function is to track three-dimensional
objects and their movements. Causal perception is part of object
perception.</p>
<p>At least three pieces of evidence suggest that perception of objects
is closely linked to causal perception. First, Michotte argued for such
a link on the basis of his finding that launching occurs when there is a
conflict between cues to object identity: good continuity of movement
suggests a single object whereas the existence of two distinct surfaces
indicates two objects.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> It is plausible that other types of
causal interaction also involve conflicts between cues to object
identity. Second, as we saw above Scholl and Nakayama have shown that
when a sequence involving complete overlap between two objects is
perceived as a launching event, subjects perceive an illusory crescent
as if the overlap were only partial.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> They conclude that
“the perception of causality can also affect other types of visual
processing—in this case the perception of spatial relations among moving
objects.”<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a> Third, Krushke and Fragassi have
shown that the object-specific preview effect vanishes in launching but
not in various spatio-temporally similar sequences.<a href="#fn57"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a>
Since the object-specific preview effect is diagnostic of feature
binding, this is evidence that in launching sequences, features of the
second object (such as motion) remain bound to the first object for a
short time after the second object starts to move.<a href="#fn58"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>These three pieces of evidence indicate that causal perception
interacts with object perception. It is not that we first see sequences
of events involving objects and then assign them causal significance.
Rather, the perception of something as a causal interaction is bound up
with what we perceive as objects in the first place.</p>
<p>This suggests a simple explanation for the correspondence between the
perceptions characteristic of various kinds of causal interaction and
conditions under which those causal interactions occur. The
correspondence exists because, given contingent facts about how it
actually works, the perceptual system responsible for identifying
objects must also concern itself with certain kinds of causal
interaction in order to reconcile conflicting cues to object identity.
In slightly more detail: one function of our perceptual systems is to
identify and track objects; this is done by means of various cues;
sometimes the visual system is faced with conflicting cues to object
identity which need to be resolved in order to arrive at a satisfactory
interpretation; when certain types of causal interaction occur there is
a conflict among cues to object identity; these conflicts must be
treated differently from other conflicts because they do not indicate
failures of object identification and so do not require resolution or
further perceptual processing. So object perception depends on
sensitivity to certain types of causal perception and this is why we
enjoy categorical perception of those types of causal interaction.</p>
<p>If this explanation is correct, we can conclude that causal
interactions are objects of perception in the same sense that intended
phonic gestures are. But this explanation is not as satisfying as the
one offered in the case of speech—that one explained <em>how</em>
intended phonic gestures could be perceived whereas this one only says
that causal interactions <em>need to be</em> perceived given how object
perception works.</p>
<p>Where can we find a deeper explanation? If, as I have been
suggesting, object perception and causal perception are one and the same
process, a theory about how object perception works might also explain
how causal interactions are perceived. Consider Elizabeth Spelke’s
theory: object perception is best understood as an inference where the
premises are descriptions of stimuli in terms of surfaces and their
layout; conclusions about objects are inferred from these premises by
means of a set of principles describing how objects behave. Here, for
example, are two of Spelke’s four principles of object perception:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>boundedness—“two surface points lie on distinct objects only if no
path of connected surface points links them … the boundedness principle
implies that … two distinct objects cannot interpenetrate.”</p>
<p>no action at a distance—“separated objects are interpreted as moving
independently of one another if such an interpretation exists.”<a
href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These principles bear not only on object identity but also on causal
interactions between objects. In the case of launching, the no action at
a distance principle is clearly relevant; for example, it would explain
why there is no launching effect without spatial contact. The
boundedness principle is also relevant, as it explains why the
experience characteristic of launching is typically absent when there is
complete overlap between two objects. In general, Spelke holds that
“object perception reflects basic constraints on the motions of physical
bodies.”<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> Developing this idea, Renee
Baillargeon, Su-hua Wang and their colleagues have argued that a single
set of principles are responsible for object segmentation and for the
perceptual identification of certain events as physically possible or
impossible.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> If this is right, the principles
which explain object perception also explain how causal perception
works.</p>
<p>This completes my argument for the claim that we can perceive certain
types of causal interaction. This argument was outlined in (1')–(4')
above. Clearly the argument is far from decisive since it depends on a
complex mix of theoretical and empirical issues. Even so, the argument
demonstrates how to respond to Hume’s claim that we do not perceive
causal interactions. Given the evidence we have so far, it is more
plausible that we perceive causal interactions than that we do not.
Equally importantly, the comparison with speech perception provides us
with some insight into what it means to perceive causal interactions:
they are perceived categorically and they are objects of perception in
the sense that intended phonic gestures are.</p>
<p>Note that strictly speaking this argument establishes only that we
perceive causal interactions when presented with visual stimuli, not
that we see them. Causal perception may be amodal, as speech perception
is sometimes held to be.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a> Even so, I’ll continue
to write about seeing causes and hearing gestures for simplicity.
Nothing said here contradicts David Marr’s view that “the quintessential
fact of human vision—[is] that it tells about shape and space and
spatial arrangement.”<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="iv.-1">IV.</h5>
<p>So far I have argued that we can see some causal interactions, and
that seeing causal interactions is part of seeing objects (seeing
objects move is interdependent with, not prior to, seeing causal
interactions). The argument followed a well-understood model from the
case of speech perception. First we found a feature of causal perception
in need of explanation, the existence of categories and their
correspondence to situations in which causal interactions occur. Then I
argued that the best explanation for this feature involves the
hypothesis that we perceive causal interactions: the feature occurs
because, given how they actually work, perceptual systems responsible
for identifying and tracking objects must also discriminate certain
types of causal interaction.</p>
<p>As mentioned at the start, many of those who agree that we can
perceive causings also claim that we perceive causings in the same sense
that we perceive shape, whatever sense that it. Full evaluation of this
further claim would involve considering issues about perception beyond
the scope of this paper. On the other hand, some evaluation of this
claim is necessary for understanding what it means to perceive causings.
In a preliminary and tentatively way, I suggest that the further claim
is false and conclude with some considerations distinguishing causal and
speech perception from shape perception.</p>
<p>Here are two claims about shape perception. First, in a wide range of
naturally occurring circumstances, perceiving an object’s shape is a way
of being aware of its shape, that is, of being in a position to think
about and act on its shape.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> Second, to describe
what someone perceives as including a particular shape is to describe a
characteristic of their experience which is, often enough,
introspectable.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> I assume that these claims are true
and constitutive of shape perception and argue that parallel claims
about causal or speech perception are false. If these claims are indeed
constitutive of shape perception but false of causal perception, then we
do not perceive causal interactions in the same sense that we perceive
shape.</p>
<p>Consider the relation between facts about the objects of speech
perception and its introspectable character. Not even the best trained,
most conceptually sophisticated experts can use introspection to resolve
conflicts about whether the objects of speech perception are sounds or
gestures. The issues that determine the conflict concern the nature of
the stimuli (what invariants are there?) and processes (does passive
speech perception involve the motor cortex?). I suspect introspection
tells us nothing about what we perceive when we perceive speech;
certainly it has no bearing on conflicts about the objects of speech
perception. So speech and shape perception differ with respect to
introspection.</p>
<p>The parallel point about causal perception is less clear because some
philosophers and psychologists seem to have held that introspection can
reveal what we perceive when we perceive causal interactions. While in
principle there might also be perceptual experiences facts about the
objects of which are knowable through introspection, the type of
perceptions Michotte studied and that have been the focus of this paper
are not such perceptions. As in the case of speech perception,
discerning the objects of causal perception depends on careful
investigation of the conditions under which they occur and the reasons
why they occur under these conditions. Introspection is inessential.</p>
<p>What about the relation between perception and awareness? In the case
of speech researchers distinguish categorical perception of phonemes
from ‘phonological awareness’, the ability to intentionally manipulate
and reason about phonemes. Phonological awareness is measured by a range
of tasks that require sorting words according to their initial phoneme,
segmenting or completing words and blending or eliding phonemes.<a
href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> Although these tasks might seem to
test obscure abilities, phonological awareness has enormous practical
value in facilitating the acquisition of literacy.</p>
<p>Several factors jointly make it necessary to distinguish perception
from awareness of phonemes. Most importantly, infants from four months
or earlier enjoy categorical perception of phonemes,<a href="#fn67"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a>
but it takes them until around four <em>years</em> before they can think
or reason about phonemes. Infants and younger children who hear ‘sat’ or
‘bat’ can distinguish the words by virtue of perceiving distinct
intended phonic gestures but cannot act on or think about this
difference.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> Perception and awareness also
differ with respect to the way they develop and the factors that
influence their development. Unlike phoneme perception, children’s
acquisition of phonological awareness develops gradually over several
years, varies systematically depending on their oral language (e.g.
Turkish vs. French), and is facilitated by learning a writing system
where some types of writing system help more than others (e.g.
syllabaries vs. alphabets). Furthermore, children find certain types of
phoneme harder to distinguish in thought than others (e.g. those that
differ only with respect to voicing are harder to distinguish than those
that differ only with respect to articulation), whereas they have no
corresponding difficulties perceiving distinctions between phonemes. In
principle there might be several ways of explaining these developmental
findings. But there is a natural explanation which is generally taken
for granted by researchers in this area: in becoming aware of phonemes
we have to rediscover them, lacking access to them as objects of
perception; and we become aware of phonemes as things which sometimes
differ with respect to their identities and properties from the intended
phonic gestures we perceive.</p>
<p>If this is correct, phoneme and shape perception differ in that
perceiving phonemes is not a way of being aware of them. What about
causal perception? As in the case of speech, there is a long gap between
perceiving and the onset of reasoning abilities. Infants enjoy
categorical perception of causal interactions from no later than
9-months,<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a> whereas children are
two-and-a-half- or three-years-old before they can engage in even the
simplest forms of causal reasoning.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> Much as in the case of
speech, children’s ability to make judgements about visually presented
causal interactions appears to improve gradually over several years up
to around 5-years-old,<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> and they have difficulty
integrating perceptual information with their reasoning.<a href="#fn72"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72" role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>
In the causal case, some investigators regard perception and awareness
as closely connected despite the developmental gap, arguing that it can
be explained by extraneous factors such as methodological deficiencies<a
href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a> or task demands<a href="#fn74"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a>.
Given the uncertainty in this area, I suggest that the points of
comparison between speech and causal perception make plausible as a
contender the alternative hypothesis that the developmental gap between
perception and awareness is explained by the fact that causal perception
is not a way of being aware of causal interactions.</p>
<p>These considerations indicate that causal perception differs from
shape perception with respect to introspection and awareness. The role
of categorical perception of causings is only to distinguish events, not
make manifest to us how the events are distinguished or the natures of
the events so distinguished. From the point of view of the perceiver,
categorical perception is simply a signal of sameness or difference with
distinctive phenomenological effects. In this respect, causal perception
is comparable to sensation: perceiving causal interactions is no more or
less a way of being aware of them than experiencing a distinctive
stinging sensation is a way of being aware of a nettle. If this is
right, causal perception may also resemble sensation with respect to
epistemology: seeing causings is not a way of gaining knowledge about
them and can be a source of knowledge only because we learn to associate
characteristic phenomenology with the kind of events that give rise to
it. Certainly we should reject the claim that causal perception is a
source of causal concepts.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>In philosophy of perception there is a divide between those who take
the claims about introspection and awareness as defining the phenomenon
and those who offer theories that are at odds with, or at least hard to
reconcile with, these claims. Fred Dretske’s views illustrate the second
school of thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Seeing objects is a way of getting information about them. […] What
makes it X (rather than Y) that we see is that the information these
internal events carry is information about X (rather than Y).”<a
href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the face of it, an internal event’s carrying information about
something does not necessarily involve either our being aware of that
thing or the event’s having a particular introspective character.
Something like Dretske’s way of thinking about perception might be true
to causal and speech perception, and perhaps categorical perception more
generally. But since these forms of perception may differ from shape
perception with respect to awareness and introspection, it doesn’t
follow that the same approach is true to shape perception. Equally,
although the first view cannot be true to causal or speech perception
because on that view it makes no sense to distinguish sharply perception
of an object from awareness of it (on this view, perceiving something
sometimes just is being aware of it), it doesn’t follow that the view is
false when restricted to non-categorical forms of perception.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we do perceive causal interactions and doing so is
part of perceiving objects. In this respect Hume was wrong, but he may
have been more right than wrong. For perceiving causal interactions may
differ from perceiving shape with respect to how such perceptions relate
to awareness and introspection. If these relations are defining
characteristics of the kind of perception involved in seeing shapes,
Michotte, Strawson, and Scholl and colleagues are wrong to regard causal
and shape perception as of a kind. We see causal interactions in the
same sense we hear intended phonic gestures.<a href="#fn77"

characteristic invariant properties … though these must be seen, not as
peripheral movements, but as the more remote structures that control the
movements. These structures correspond to the speaker’s intentions.” So
far these “remote structures” are hypothetical (Alvin M. Liberman and

cognitive effort required to comprehend speech and can hinder or
facilitate learning in different situations Nygaard and Pisoni, “Speech

undertaking to give a rigorous, plausible and useful characterisation of

<li id="fn62"><p>The evidence on this point is controversial. Sekuler
and colleagues show that when subjects observe an ambiguous visual
display consistent with either a collision or a passing event, the
timing of a tone can control whether subjects report seeing a collision
or passing, and argue that this is a multisensory phenomenon (Robert
Sekuler, Allison B. Sekuler, and Renee Lau, “Sound Alters Visual Motion
Perception,” <em>Nature</em> 385, no. 23 January 1997 (1997).). Wantabe
and Shimojo extend this finding by showing that not any event (or
non-event) which draws attention at the moment of a collision will
disambiguate the display; they argue that the tone’s effect on the
perception of a collision is a “genuine audiovisual effect, not an
audiovisual effect that results from auditory effects” (Katsumi Watanabe
and Shinsuke Shimojo, “When Sound Affects Vision--Effects of Auditory
Grouping on Visual Motion Perception,” <em>Psychological Science</em>
12, no. 2 (2001).). Guski and Troje, on the other hand, show that
features which carry no information about causation, such as a blink,
can also influence whether subjects report seeing a collision or a
passing. These authors conclude that auditory influences on the
perceptual of collisions are “no true cross-modal phenomenon” (Rainer
Guski and Nikolaus F. Troje, “Audiovisual Phenomenal Causality,”

Converging Evidence from Four Studies of Preschool and Early Grade
School Children,” <em>Journal of Educational Psychology</em> 96, no. 1

awareness at slightly different times, they are collectively taken to
measure phonological awareness because longitudinal surveys have shown
that success or failure on these tasks is best explained by a single
factor (see Jason L. Anthony and David J. Francis, “Development of

<li id="fn67"><p>Eimas and colleagues trained infants to suck in order
to hear a sound and were then able to identify infants’ interest in
different sounds by measuring how vigorously they suck in order to hear
the next sound. Since novel sounds are more interesting than familiar
sounds, this experiment reveals which sounds infants regard as different
and which they treat as the same. The headline finding is that
four-month-olds have categorical perception of some phonemes (Peter D.
Eimas et al., “Speech Perception in Infants,” <em>Science</em> 171, no.
3968 (1971).).</p>
<p>Further research established that infants perceive many phones much
as adults do. See Peter Jusczyk, “Language Acquisition: Speech Sounds
and the Beginning of Phonology,” in <em>Speech, Language and
Communication</em>, ed. Joanne Miller, L. and Peter D. Eimas (San Diego:
Academic Press, 1995), 267.: “from a very early age, infants
discriminate many, if not all, of the contrasts that are likely to occur
among words in the native language. Moreover, at least on a general
level, there are some striking similarities between the way that infants
and adults respond to the same kinds of speech contrasts.”<a
