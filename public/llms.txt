Event: Developmental Aspects of Joint Intentions and Actions
Place: Institut Jean-Nicod, Ecole Normale Superieure, Paris

Summary: <p>How can we explain the emergence, in evolution or development, of sophisticated forms of theory of mind cognition? One conjecture is that their emergence somehow involves joint action (Knoblich & Sebanz, 2006; Hughes & Leekam, 2004; Moll & Tomasello, 2007). This raises two questions.

Year: 2012
Date: 2012-11-20
Place: Department of Philosophy, Central European University, Budapest

Summary: Shared agency is paradigmatically involved when two or more people paint a house together, tidy the toys away together, or lift a two-handled basket together. To characterise shared agency, some philosophers have appealed to a special kind of intention or structure of intention, knowledge or commitment often called shared intention'.

Year: 2011
Date: 2011-06-05
Event: Rational Agency
Place: Center for Integrative Neuroscience, University of Tuebingen

Summary: <p>Several researchers have conjectured that joint action partially explains how sophisticated forms of cognition emerge in development or evolution (for example, Knoblich & Sebanz 2006; Moll & Tomasello 2007). If any such conjecture is correct, what could joint action be?

URL: /talks/2013/metacognition_and_mindreading/
Year: 2013
Date: 2013-01-24
Event: All Souls Metacognition Seminars
Place: University of Oxford

Summary: The success of infants and nonhuman animals on some belief reasoning tasks may be best explained by a cognitively efficient but inflexible capacity for tracking belief-like states. In humans, this capacity persists in parallel with a later-developing, more flexible but more cognitively demanding theory-of-mind abilities.

Year: 2013
Date: 2013-09-12
Event: Emotion and Social Cognition
Place: University of Manchester

Summary: How could we come to know that another is angry about an obstacle she has encountered, or that she is happy about an outcome? Some such knowledge is uncontroversially acquired by inference. However, some philosophers have recently defended the hypothesis that knowledge of others' anger or joy might be acquired by perceiving it (e. g.

Event: Theory of Mind, Simulation and Meta-Cognition: Laureate's Colloquium with Josef Perner
Place: Center for interdisciplinary Research (ZiF), Bielefeld University

Summary: We argue that mindreading involves not only multiple systems but also multiple models (or theories) of the mind. The argument turns on three questions. First, how could mindreading be both flexible and efficient? We suggest that, in a sense it can't.

URL: /talks/2014/joint_action_without_mindreading/
Year: 2014
Date: 2014-04-22
Place: Berlin School of Mind and Brain, Humboldt Universität zu Berlin, Germany

Summary: Joint action is a familiar feature of everyday life. Paradigmatic joint actions include things like painting a house together, walking together and playing a piano duet. On leading accounts of joint action, engaging in joint action presupposes mindreading abilities. But are there forms of joint action engaging in which would not require mindreading?

Year: 2014
Date: 2014-11-07
Event: Minimal Mindreading
Place: University of Magdeburg, Germany

Summary: This talk introduces a series of hypotheses and claims about the systems and models involved in mindreading (or ‘theory of mind’), explains how they generate predictions by drawing a parallel with cognition of physical properties like momentum, and highlights some recent evidence indicating that some of the hypotheses may be correct.

Type: Talk

Year: 2015
Date: 2015-12-16
Place: University of Tuebingen, Germany

Summary: How could we come to know that another is angry about an insult or happy about an outcome? Some philosophers have defended the hypothesis that knowledge of others' anger or joy is sometimes perceptual (e. g. Smith, 2010, 2015; McNeill, 2012a,b). In this talk I consider two challenges to this hypothesis.

Summary: is a familiar feature of everyday life: people move tables together, walk together, play piano duets and cooperatively rear babies. For social (and eusocial) animals, effective joint action is necessary for survival. It also arguably explains the emergence, in evolution or development, of sophisticated cognitive capacities.

Summary: How can we explain the emergence, in evolution or development, of mindreading? Some conjecture that its emergence involves joint action (Knoblich & Sebanz, 2006; Moll & Tomasello, 2007). Reflection on objections to this conjecture reveals mistakes in leading philosophical accounts of both mindreading and joint action.

Year: 2011-2
Term: Autumn
Place: Department of Cognitive Science, Central European University, Budapest

Summary: This course will introduce a variety of new and established philosophical ideas that might usefully inform experimental research on mindreading or on joint action (or both) but have so far been neglected or misunderstood by cognitive scientists. Starting from foundational questions like <i>What is a mental state? </i> and <i>Which events are actions?

Year: 2022-22
Term: Autumn
Place: University of Milan, Italy

Summary: Two systems theories of reasoning are well-known and widely discussed. However less attention has been paid to two systems (or dual process) theories in other domains. What are two systems theories, and in which domains are they defensible?

Title: Mindreading is an Asynchronous Joint Activity: The M-a-J-a Account of Theory of Mind Performance, and Individual Differences
Authors: Apperly, Ian and Devine, Rory T. and Butterfill, Stephen A.
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/apperly2025_mindreading/
Year: 2025

Summary: Research on mindreading has been dominated by questions about the presence, absence or nature of mindreading concepts or structures, and by paradigms designed to create the most favourable circumstances for demonstrating such abilities. This focus on competence has led to a neglect of questions about performance.

Title: Three strategies for shared intention: plural, aggregate and reductive
Authors: Butterfill, Stephen A.
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/butterfill2025_three/
Year: 2025

Summary: When deciding on a strategy for explicating shared intention, we all face two fundamental questions. First, can an intention or any other mental state have more than one subject? A positive answer to this allows the plural subject strategy: shared intention is a matter of there being one mental state with two or more subjects.

Year: 2022

Summary: In the current study, we separately tested whether coordinated decision-making increases altruism and whether it increases trust. To this end, we implemented a paradigm in which participants repeatedly perform a coordinated decision-making task either with the same partner on every trial, or with a different partner on each trial.

Title: Joint Action Goals Reduce Visuomotor Interference Effects from a Partner’s Incongruent Actions
Authors: Sam Clarke, Luke McEllin, Anna Francová, Marcell Székely, Stephen A. Butterfill and John Michael
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/clarke2019_joint/
Year: 2019

Summary: Joint actions often require agents to track others’ actions while planning and executing physically incongruent actions of their own. Previous research has indicated that this can lead to visuomotor interference effects when it occurs outside of joint action. How is this avoided or overcome in joint actions?

Year: 2016

Summary: Characterizing the cognitive architecture of human mindreading forces us to address two puzzles in people’s attributions of belief: why children show inconsistent expectations about others’ belief-based actions, and why adults’ belief reasoning is sometimes automatic and sometimes not.

Type: Publication
URL: /writing/collective_goals/
Year: 2022

Summary: Anyone who has ever walked, cooked or crafted with a friend is in a position to know that acting jointly is not just acting side-by-side. But what distinguishes acting jointly from acting in parallel yet merely individually? Four decades of philosophical research have yielded broad consensus on a strategy for answering this question.

Year: 2009

Summary: The authors examined cue competition effects in young children using the blicket detector paradigm, in which objects are placed either singly or in pairs on a novel machine and children must judge which objects have the causal power to make the machine work. Cue competition effects were found in a 5- to 6-year-old group but not in a 4-year-old group.

Year: 2017

Summary: Current theory-of-mind research faces the challenge of reconciling two sets of seemingly incompatible findings: Whereas children come to solve explicit verbal false belief (FB) tasks from around 4 years of age, recent studies with various less explicit measures such as looking time, anticipatory looking, and spontaneous behavior suggest that even infants can…

Authors: Elizabeth J. Robinson, Stephen A. Butterfill and Erika Nurmsoo
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/gaining_knowledge_via_other_minds/
Year: 2011

Summary: In five experiments, we examined 3- to 6-year-olds' understanding that they could gain knowledge indirectly from someone who had seen something they had not. Consistent with previous research, children judged that an informant, who had seen inside a box, knew its contents.

Title: Goals and Targets: A Developmental Puzzle about Sensitivity to Others’ Actions
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/goals_targets/
Year: 2021

Summary: Sensitivity to others’ actions is essential for social animals like humans and a fundamental requirement for any kind of social cognition. Unsurprisingly, it is present in humans from early in the first year of life. But what processes underpin infants’ sensitivity to others’ actions?

Title: Infants' Representations of Causation (Commentary on Susan Carey, The Origin of Concepts)
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Type: Publication

Title: Interacting Mindreaders
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/interacting_mindreaders/
Year: 2012

Summary: Could interacting mindreaders be in a position to know things which they would be unable to know if they were manifestly passive observers? This paper argues that they could. Mindreading is sometimes reciprocal: the mindreader's target reciprocates by taking the mindreader as a target for mindreading.

Title: Intuitions about Joint Commitment
Authors: John Michael and Stephen A. Butterfill
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/intuitions_about_joint_commitment/
Year: 2022

Summary: In what sense is commitment essential to joint action, and do the participants in a joint action themselves perceive commitment as essential? Attempts to answer this question have so far been hampered by clashes of intuition. Perhaps this is because the intuitions in question have mostly been investigated using informal methods only.

Title: Joint Action: What Is Shared?  Introduction to the special issue
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill and Natalie Sebanz
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/joint_action_rpp_special_issue/
Year: 2011

Summary: Joint action raises a tangle of philosophical, developmental and cognitive questions. Many of these questions are naturally understood to be about sharing, about the sharing of intentions, emotions, task representations, and action plans. Of course it is not easy to explain what it means to share in this context.

Title: Mindreading in the Balance: Adults’ Mediolateral Leaning and Anticipatory Looking Foretell Others’ Action Preparation in a False-Belief Interactive Task
Authors: Giovanni Zani, Stephen A. Butterfill and Jason Low
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/mindreading_balance/
Year: 2020

Summary: Anticipatory looking on mindreading tasks can indicate our expectation of an agent's action. The challenge is that social situations are often more complex, involving instances where we need to track an agent's false belief to successfully identify the outcome to which an action is directed.

Title: How to Construct a Minimal Theory of Mind
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill and Ian A. Apperly
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/minimal_theory_of_mind/
Year: 2013

Summary: What could someone represent that would enable her to track, at least within limits, others' perceptions, knowledge states and beliefs including false beliefs? An obvious possibility is that she might represent these very attitudes as such. It is sometimes tacitly or explicitly assumed that this is the only possible answer.

Title: What are Modules and What Is Their Role in Development?
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/modularity/
Year: 2007

Summary: Modules are widely held to play a central role in explaining mental development and in accounts of the mind generally. But there is much disagreement about what modules are, which shows that we do not adequately understand modularity. This paper outlines a Fodoresque approach to understanding one type of modularity.

Title: Motor Representation and Action Experience in Joint Action
Authors: Corrado Sinigaglia and Stephen A. Butterfill
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/motor_representation_action_experience/
Year: 2020

Summary: Acting together with a purpose is a familiar feature of everyday life. We jump together, play music together and move tables together. But what do we experience of action in acting together?

Title: Motor Representation in Goal Ascription
Authors: Corrado Sinigaglia and Stephen A. Butterfill
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/motor_representation_in_goal_ascription/
Year: 2016

Summary: Goal ascription, the process of identifying outcomes to which purposive actions are directed, is indispensable for predicting others’ behaviours and understanding their minds. But which mechanisms underpin goal ascription? This chapter examines several ways in which motor representations and processes are involved in different forms of goal ascription.

Title: Visibly constraining an agent modulates observers’ automatic false-belief tracking
Authors: Jason Low, Katheryn Edwards & Stephen A. Butterfill
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/mummification/
Year: 2020

Summary: Our motor system can generate representations which carry information about the goals of another agent’s actions. However, it is not known whether motor representations play a deeper role in social understanding, and, in particular, whether they enable tracking others’ beliefs.

Title: Principles of belief acquisition. How we read other minds
Authors: Pascarelli, M. T. and Quarona, D. and Barchiesi, G. and Riva, G. and Butterfill, S. A. and Sinigaglia, C.
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/pascarelli2024_principles/
Year: 2024

Summary: Reading other minds is a pervasive feature of human social life. A decade of research indicates that people can automatically track an agent’s beliefs regardless of whether this is required. But little is known about the principles t guide automatic belief tracking. In six experiments adapting a false belief task introduced by Kovacs et al.

Title: Perceiving Expressions of Emotion: What evidence could bear on questions about perceptual experience of mental states?
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/perceiving_expressions_emotion/

Title: Planning for Collective Agency
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/planning_for_collective_agency/
Year: 2016

Summary: Which planning mechanisms enable agents to coordinate their actions, and what if anything do these tell us about the nature of collective agency? On the leading, best developed account, Michael Bratman's, collective agency is explained in terms of interconnected planning.

Title: Review of Thinking without Words by Jose Luis Bermudez
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/review_thinking_without_words/
Year: 2004

Summary: <p>That some animals, early hominids and infants think (or did so once) is increasingly hard to doubt. Our evidence includes everything from the manufacture and use of tools (55, 127), to the ways infants react when shown apparently impossible physical events (81). Bermdez' project is to explain the nature of this thinking.

Title: Seeing Causes and Hearing Gestures
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/seeing_causes/
Year: 2009

Summary: Can humans see causal interactions? Evidence on the visual perception of causal interactions, from Michotte to contemporary work, is best interpreted as showing that we can see some causal interactions in the same sense as that in which we can hear speech. Causal perception, like speech perception, is a form of categorical perception.

Title: Two Kinds of Purposive Action
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/two_kinds_of_purposive_action/
Year: 2001

Summary: It is normally assumed that there is only one kind of purposive action. This article argues that there are two kinds of purposive action, which require different models of explanation. One kind of action is done without awareness of reasons; another kind of action is done because the agent is aware of reasons for that action.

Title: Is Goal Ascription Possible in Minimal Mindreading?
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill and Ian A. Apperly
Type: Publication
URL: /writing/two_systems_goal_ascription/
Year: 2016

Summary: In this response to the commentary by Michael and Christensen, we first explain how minimal mindreading is compatible with the development of increasingly sophisticated mindreading behaviours that involve both executive functions and general knowledge, and then sketch one approach to a minimal account of goal ascription.
