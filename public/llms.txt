Title: Awareness of Belief
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2001
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Is it possible to appreciate how different people may have beliefs different from one's own (including beliefs which are inconsistent with one's own beliefs) without understanding what it is for beliefs to be true or false?  In this paper I argue that it is.

Title: Towards a Blueprint for a Social Animal
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill and Elisabeth Pacherie
Year: 2020
Type: Publication

## Abstract

<p>In this chapter, we attempt to answer the question, By what steps could members of a group capable of acting together with a purpose, coordinating flexibly, communicating cooperatively and deceiving competitors be constructed from creatures with minimal social skills and cognitive abilities? The method we use is creature construction: the idea is to adopt the perspective of a designer tasked with specifying a sequence of creatures, where each is independently viable and has the capacities of its predecessors together with some new capacity which enables it to overcome limits its predecessors faced. In creature construction, the aim is not to characterise actual species, nor to describe actual evolutionary or developmental processes. Instead the aims are to understand how various forms (or prototypes) of joint action are related to, and diverge from, each other; and to identify limits on what can be achieved with a given set of cognitive and social skills.</p><p>We start with Alphonso and his kin, whose social cognition is limited to tracking the goals of others’ actions. We show that despite little cognitive sophistication, the salience and triangulation heuristics enables them to initiate simple joint actions requiring coordination. One group of their descendants, Beki and her kin, develop abilities to produce pointing gestures and object-directed vocalisations, that enable them to enlist others not yet as partners but as social tools, thus extending the range of situations in which they can rely on the salience and triangulation heuristics. Another group of Alphonso’s descendants, Bemi’s kin, learn the art of strategic deception, acquiring increasingly elaborate tactics for manipulating others’ action possibilities. This advantages them in competition. Finally, the Kimi, who are mixed descendants of both the Beki and the Bemi, inherit the former’s communicative abilities and the latter’s abilities for tactical deception. Progressively integrating the two allows them to develop new capacities of selective deception.</p><p>We argue that although our creatures do not yet have all the cognitive capacities classical accounts imply are needed for joint action, they have proxies for some of these capacities. These proxies allow them to coordinate in a limited but useful range of ordinary circumstances. Further, relying on such proxies provide ways of avoiding both omni-doxasticity and omni-intentionality when acting together.</p>

Title: Interpersonal Functioning in Borderline Personality Disorder Traits: A Social Media Perspective
Authors: Jinnie Ooi, John Michael, Sakari Lemola, Stephen A. Butterfill, Cynthia S. Q. Siew & Lukasz Walasek

Journal: Scientific Reports
Type: Publication

## Abstract

This is the first study to demonstrate interpersonal difficulties associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD) features in the domain of social media. Using crowdsourcing, we presented participants with a battery of questions about their recent social media use, and then assessed their BPD features using the short form of the Five-Factor Borderline Inventory. The results revealed that individuals with higher BPD trait scores reported posting more often on social media, as well as a higher incidence of experiencing regret after posting on social media, and of deleting or editing their posts. They also report a higher degree of importance of social media in their social behavior and daily routines. These results highlight the pervasiveness of interpersonal difficulties associated with BPD features even in the non-clinical population, and demonstrate that these difficulties are also observable in social media behavior. Our findings may provide a starting point for research using data from social media to illuminate the cognitive and emotional processes underpinning the interpersonal difficulties associated with BPD features, and to inform and assess therapeutic interventions.

Title: Three strategies for shared intention: plural, aggregate and reductive
Authors: Butterfill, Stephen A.
Year: 2025
Journal: Philosophical Psychology
Type: Publication

<div class="fulltext">
<h1 id="sec:introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Start with the idea that shared intention, whatever that is, is
something which makes things we do together the genuinely joint
activities they are. We manifest shared intention in walking together,
playing a piano duet, or painting a house together. Philosophers, in
attempting to elucidate ideas about shared intention, have followed
three distinct strategies. One involves plural subjects, one aggregate
subjects,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and one a reduction of the
apparently plural or aggregate to the merely individual.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
Whereas these strategies are usually presented as conflicting attempts
to characterise a single set of phenomena, my thesis is that for each
strategy there are phenomena which can be correctly characterised only
by following that strategy.</p>
<p>This thesis is not entirely novel. Both <span class="citation"
data-cites="list_pettit:2011">List and Pettit (2011)</span> and <span
class="citation" data-cites="bratman:2022_shared">Bratman
(2022a)</span>, for instance, have developed views on which, roughly
speaking, a reductive strategy is applied to small-scale, informal
interactions whereas the aggregate strategy is applied to corporate or
institutional agents.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> My thesis is that, similarly, a
combination of strategies may be needed even when restricting attention
to small-scale interactions involving two or three people.</p>
<p>What consequences would follow from this thesis if true—if, that is,
each of the three strategies is needed to characterise some phenomena
associated with shared intention? This would make things easier in one
way: it is not necessary for proponents of one strategy to refute the
theories invented by those following a different strategy. This would be
a good outcome because, despite much effort, few if any existing
attempts to refute particular theories of shared intention are widely
regarded as successful. But it would also make things harder in another
way. For if there is not one set of things that the different theories
are aiming to fully capture, then it will not be possible to specify the
target of a theory simply by reference to shared intention. We will need
a deeper understanding of what each particular theory is aiming to
explain.</p>
<p>Superficially, the need for a deeper understanding of targets of
explanation might not seem like much of a challenge. After all, we
already know that some theorists primarily target semantics <span
class="citation" data-cites="ludwig_collective_2007">(Ludwig
2007)</span>, others ‘the deep structure of our thought about acting
together’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="gilbert:2022_simple">(Gilbert 2022, 2)</span>, and yet
others ‘the explanatory structures that directly underlie [...] cases of
acting together’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="bratman:2022_planning">(Bratman 2022b, 7)</span>. There are,
then, already things written about what theories of shared intention aim
to explain. Yet little attention has been given to the possibility of
co-existence. The usual assumption is that the various strategies lead
to theories which do contradict each other; or else, more rarely, that
multiple strategies can be combined in pursuit of a single explanatory
target.</p>
<p>We already know that it is coherent to pursue a combination of
strategies because some have already done this. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bratman:2014_book">Bratman (2014, 127ff)</span>, for
example, considers the possibility that his reductive strategy yields a
theory on which there are also what he calls ‘group agents’ (for which I
shall use the term ‘aggregate agents’; see section <a
href="#sec:aggregate" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:aggregate">5</a>). This is a relatively conservative
way of combining strategies. Not only is there a single explanatory
target, but the group agents are merely epiphenomena of the reductive
strategy. The novel feature of what follows is the observation that
different explanatory targets require different strategies, which, as we
will see, appears to create a challenge to understanding
co-existence.</p>
<p>If, as the following argues, multiple different strategies for shared
intention really are needed, then we all face a problem. The problem is
that we, as researchers, need, but lack, a common understanding of what
theories of shared intention are theories of.</p>
<h1 id="sec:live-it-out">Living Out a Theory</h1>
<p>My thesis is that, for each strategy for explicating shared
intention, there are phenomena which can be correctly characterised only
by following that strategy. The argument for this thesis (in section <a
href="#sec:multiple-strategies" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:multiple-strategies">8</a>) will hinge on the idea
that it is possible, in some cases, to make a theory true by living it
out. To avoid surprises later, this section introduces that idea.</p>
<p>While laws of mechanics apply no less to us agents than to anything
else, it would usually be futile, perhaps even incoherent, to attempt to
move according to these laws. By contrast, one of the roles of mental
state attribution is to provide norms which individuals can measure
themselves against and aim to live by <span class="citation"
data-cites="mcgeer:2007_regulative zawidzki:2013_mindshaping">(McGeer
2007; Zawidzki 2013)</span>.</p>
<p>To illustrate, consider the norm of agglomeration: it is a mistake to
knowingly have several intentions if it would be a mistake to knowingly
have one large intention agglomerating the several intentions (<span
class="citation" data-cites="Bratman:1987xw">(Bratman 1987)</span>).
Whether this is actually a mistake is controversial—several philosophers
have defended views of intention which are incompatible with it <span
class="citation" data-cites="setiya:2022_intention">(Setiya 2022, sec.
4)</span>. But regardless of that, it is possible some people might,
however mistakenly, take agglomeration as an ideal by which to live.
They check their intentions against the norm and criticise each other
for failing to implement it. It is equally possible that another group
of people, having considered the matter deeply, intentionally disregard
the norm of agglomeration. In their view, adhering to this norm would be
a mistake.</p>
<p>The possibility that some ordinary agents might adopt or reject the
norm of agglomeration in practice raises a question. Are ordinary
agents’ views ever relevant to whether the norm is correct? Imagine we
were to say, crudely, that whether the norm holds is just a matter of
whether people take it to hold. Such a view faces myriad challenges. One
is to accommodate the fact that ordinary agents are wrong about norms,
at least occasionally (as the present author can attest). Another
challenge is to avoid a regress. This is not a line I propose to
develop. Alternatively, one might take a hard line and insist that
ordinary agents’ views are irrelevant to whether the norm of
agglomeration holds. Taking this line is complicated by the fact that
ordinary agents’ views shape at least some of their thoughts and
actions. Their views are not idle speculations about themselves but can
form ideals which they attempt to live out. Someone who takes the hard
line cannot therefore claim to be explaining how ordinary agents think
or act. Minimally, then, anyone pursuing this line would have to
identify which phenomena their position is supposed to explain. A
further challenge is that philosophers’ methods involve intuition,
imagination and reasoning about consistency. These methods are good for
identifying possible ways things could be. But where there are multiple
theoretically coherent positions on which fully-informed ordinary agents
reasonably differ, these methods are not likely to yield insight into
how things actually are.</p>
<p>Resolving the issue of how, if at all, ordinary agents’ views are
relevant to the correctness of the norm of agglomeration is beyond
anything I can offer here (or anywhere else). But for our purposes, what
matters is a relatively uncontroversial point. There is a difference
between, on the one hand, things which are merely described and
predicted by a set of attributions and, on the other hand, agents who
are attempting to live out a set of attributions together with some
norms governing them. You might have a view about how combinations of
yeast, sugar and heat can be used to influence how dough rises, but the
dough itself has no perspective. And even if the dough achieved
self-awareness, that would matter only insofar as its self-awareness
influenced variables you care about. When ascribing attitudes and norms
to agents, by contrast, philosophers are not required to adopt the
outsiders’ perspective—they can also take into account the agents’ own
perspective.</p>
<p>Characterising intentions and norms from some agents’ own perspective
is a familiar and coherent philosophical project. Where some agents are
attempting to live out a theory, it is reasonable to accept, in the
absence of overriding reasons such as incoherence, ignorance or
inertness, that the theory could be true of them.</p>
<p>Perhaps this will seem too hypothetical to be worth taking seriously.
We have no idea which, if any, ordinary agents aim to live by the norm
of agglomeration and which, if any, aim not to. My sense, however, is
that philosophical theories are not supposed to depend on any such
facts. They are, after all, usually developed independently of any
investigation into what ordinary agents think.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Not that it has to be hypothetical. Consider the familiar distinction
between revealed and stated preferences. To illustrate, in investigating
the value people place on a life, we could observe how much less people
pay to own a house near a known source of carcinogenic pollution. Or,
alternatively, we could give them a questionnaire asking how much they
would pay to eliminate the same risk. A wide range of research has
examined how revealed and stated preferences diverge (<span
class="citation"
data-cites="carson:1996_contingent alberini:2019_revealed">(Carson et
al. 1996; Alberini 2019)</span>, for example). There is also research on
the factors that ‘often create a wedge between revealed and normative
preferences’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="beshears:2008_how">(Beshears et al. 2008, 1788)</span>.
Divergences between revealed and stated preferences matter in practice
because they create difficult questions for policy makers on how much to
invest in preventing deaths. For our, more theoretical purposes, the
divergence illustrates how understanding agents’ actions requires taking
into account their own perspectives. Agents’ stated preferences are
views about how a model applies to them. Because agents sometimes aim to
live out these views, they are not inert commentary. The problem is not
fundamentally that this complicates predicting behaviour. It is that
where agents aim to conform to a model, incorrect predictions do not
have the same significance.</p>
<p>The distinction between revealed and stated preferences illustrates
the dual role of theories of attitudes and norms, in prediction and in
offering ideals which people can attempt to live out. There is a
difference between, on the one hand, things which are merely described
and predicted by a set of attributions and, on the other hand, agents
who are are attempting to live out a set of attributions together with
some laws governing them. In the latter case, the agents’ aiming to live
out a theory is a reason not to reject that theory insofar our aims
include understanding the agents’ own perspective.</p>
<p>The argument that follows is an attempt to apply this general point
to philosophical theories of shared intention. My aim is to show that
for each of the three strategies for shared intention—plural, aggregate
and reductive—there is at least one consistent theory following this
strategy which it is possible for people to intentionally live out. This
thesis is probably either too odd or too obvious to be interesting in
its own right, but I will suggest that it has consequences which
complicate existing attempts to understand shared intention. As these
consequences depend on the aims of a theory of shared intention, I start
with the aims.</p>
<h1 id="sec:background">Background on Shared Intention</h1>
<p>Why do we need a notion of shared intention at all? Because it is
what distinguishes genuinely joint activities from things people do in
parallel but merely individually <span class="citation"
data-cites="gilbert_walking_1990 bratman:2022_planning">(Gilbert 1990;
Bratman 2022b)</span>. This is, of course, at most a partial answer. The
hope is that investigating a notion such as shared intention will enable
us, eventually, to ‘discover the nature of social groups in general’
<span class="citation" data-cites="gilbert_walking_1990">(Gilbert 1990,
2)</span> and to understand the conceptual, metaphysical and normative
aspects of basic forms of sociality <span class="citation"
data-cites="bratman:2014_book">(Bratman 2014, 3)</span>. But one route
to these lofty goals is to focus on distinguishing genuinely joint from
merely parallel activities in mundane cases involving two or three
people.</p>
<p>Ayesha and Ahmed have spent the morning in the kitchen washing the
dishes together. This is a paradigm case of joint activity. We can
contrast Ayesha and Ahmed’s activities with those of two anti-social
people who act in parallel but merely individually. The idea is that
these other, anti-social people wash the dishes side-by-side, but their
actions are merely performed in parallel and so do not involve any joint
activity. What distinguishes Ayesha and Ahmed’s activities from these
other people’s?</p>
<p>A temptingly simple idea is to appeal to coordination. Could Ayesha
and Ahmed’s activities be distinguished by virtue of being coordinated?
The obstacle is that acting in parallel can also involve coordination.
The actions of the other, anti-social people, who are merely acting in
parallel, may nevertheless need to be tightly coordinated because space
in their communal kitchen is limited. They may also politely anticipate
each other’s movements and work around them. Mere coordination, then,
cannot distinguish joint activity.</p>
<p>The failure of this and other simple ideas hints that distinguishing
joint activities from their parallel but merely individual counterparts
is a deep and difficult problem. This problem is a variant of one about
ordinary, individual action. The ‘Problem of Action’ is to distinguish a
person’s actions from things that merely happen to them <span
class="citation" data-cites="frankfurt1978problem">(Frankfurt
1978)</span>. If ordinary, individual intention is key to solving that
problem, perhaps some joint counterpart of intention is the key to
solving the problem of joint action. This motivates using the term
<em>shared intention</em> to label whatever the normative or
psychological structure is needed to distinguish joint activities from
things people do in parallel but merely individually.</p>
<p>Introducing a label for the problem does not take us very far towards
a solution. The problem now becomes to say what shared intention is. One
possibility is the plural subject strategy: shared intention is a matter
of there being one mental state with two or more subjects.</p>
<h1 id="sec:plural">The Plural Subject Strategy</h1>
<p>A plural subject is two or more people who are each among the
subjects of a single intention or other mental state.</p>
<p>The difficulty of understanding the plural subject strategy is mainly
that it is so simple. Intentions and other mental states involve
subjects, attitudes and contents. The content is what distinguishes two
intentions from each other—the intention to cook dinner from the
intention to go for a walk, say, differ in content. Attitude is what
distinguishes intentions from other mental states—the intention to go
for a walk differs in attitude from the desire to go for a walk. And the
subject is what distinguishes your mental states from mine. The idea of
the plural subject strategy is just that intentions can have more than
one subject. You and I can share an intention in the same sense that
siblings share a parent. Your intention to walk may also be my intention
to walk: you and I are equally subjects of this intention.</p>
<p>It is helpful, in thinking about the contrast between individual and
plural subjects, to draw on a related distinction between distributive
and collective interpretations of sentences. Consider these
sentences:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The fans left the stadium.</p></li>
<li><p>The fans completely blocked the road. <span
id="item:fans-blocking" label="item:fans-blocking"></span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The first sentence is naturally read distributively: it is a matter
of each fan individually leaving. But the second sentence is naturally
read collectively. As the road is very wide, not even the largest
individual fan did much at all to block the road. But because so many
fans were milling around in the road, it was impossible to traverse it.
So understood, the second sentence’s truth is not, or not only, a matter
of each fan individually blocking the road. This is a collective
reading. The distinction seems applicable to sentences about
intention:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The twins intended to win the race. <span
id="item:twins-intention" label="item:twins-intention"></span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>If we imagine a race that can only have one winner, a 100 meter
sprint, say, then it is natural to read this sentence distributively.
Its truth is just a matter of each twin intending to win the race. But
if we imagine the twins running in a three-legged race together, it
seems possible to read the sentence collectively. On this reading, there
is one intention whose subject is the twins. They are, to put it
colourfully, of one mind.</p>
<p>We can describe the twins as a <em>plural subject</em>. But note that
the plural subject is nothing other than the twins themselves. We must
avoid confusion on this point in order to distinguish plural subjects
from aggregate subjects, which are fundamentally different (more on this
in section <a href="#sec:aggregate" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:aggregate">5</a>).</p>
<p>The plural subject strategy requires no novel conceptual,
metaphysical or normative ingredients over and above those already
required in a theory of ordinary, individual action—it can be
implemented in ways that respect Bratman’s continuity thesis. <a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Just as the truth of the collective
reading of (<a href="#item:fans-blocking" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="item:fans-blocking">[item:fans-blocking]</a>) () does
not require anything other than the fans to mill in the road, so the
truth of statements about intention collectively read requires nothing
other than intentions and their subjects.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>But are there really plural subjects of intention? One possibility is
that there merely seem to be, and are not actually, collective readings
of sentences about intentions like (<a href="#item:twins-intention"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="item:twins-intention">[item:twins-intention]</a>) above.
There are a range of objections along these lines. Most extreme is the
claim that all apparently collective predication is really disguised
distributive predication. A more limited objection is that statements
about actions and intentions merely seem to have collective readings.
<span class="citation" data-cites="ludwig:2016_individual">Ludwig (2016,
chap. 9)</span> offers a detailed discussion along these lines. His
conclusion is carefully nuanced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘we do not need to accept genuine plural [...] agents into our
ontology in order to accept what we say about [...] collective action,
at least insofar as we express this using plural subject terms.’ <span
class="citation" data-cites="ludwig:2016_individual">(Ludwig 2016,
168)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ludwig might be right that semantic considerations do not force us to
accept that plural subjects exist. Given his further premise that plural
subjects should be avoided if possible, this would be a compelling
argument against the existence of coherent collective readings. But,
importantly, Ludwig finds nothing forcing us to reject their existence
either. So as long as there is either no general presumption against
plural subjects or else sufficient reason to suppose that they are
necessary, it is not incoherent to imagine statements about intention
have true collective readings. Minimally, collective readings are a
helpful tool for clarifying what the plural subject strategy is.</p>
<p>But is it really coherent to suppose that intentions might have more
than one subject? One might object that to have an intention it is
necessary to have a mind; and that having a mind minimally involves
having a range of mental states, and perhaps even being self-aware. <a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="Schmid:2013_self">Schmid (2013)</span>, who has perhaps the
best-developed version of the plural subject strategy, accepts this
constraint but argues that there are no good grounds for supposing that
it could not be met. Likewise, <span class="citation"
data-cites="helm_plural_2008">Helm (2008)</span> argues that there are
plural subjects with a range of ‘emotions and desires in the right sort
of rational structure’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="helm_plural_2008">(Helm 2008, 29)</span>. Of course this
would mean that plural subjects are unlikely to be involved in
spontaneous interactions between strangers, as when I am struggling to
propel my heavy push chair on to the bus and you helpfully seize the
front and we lift together. Plural subjects on views like Schmid’s or
Helm’s would require vastly more intimate, long-term connections between
individuals.</p>
<p>If we follow Schmid or Helm, it is possible to wonder how there could
be plural subjects. And the sense of mystery one might have about this
could, perhaps, motivate rejecting the entire strategy in favour of
apparently less mysterious alternatives. But this would be an error. Any
of the strategies can be developed in ways that will seem mysterious to
at least some philosophers. But one of my aims is to draw attention to
the existence of straightforward, nonmysterious ways of developing each
strategy.</p>
<p>An alternative, potentially less mysterious plural subject view might
be based on rejecting the claim that having an intention entails having
a range of mental states. This view could be inspired by reflection that
humans are prone to attribute mental states on the slightest of pretexts
to things which, as they know, lack not only minds but even physical
bodies <span class="citation" data-cites="Heider:1944ts">(Heider and
Simmel 1944)</span>.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Whether or not things cannot
actually have intentions without having minds, no such constraint
appears to apply to at least one significant strand of everyday
thinking. Perhaps, then, the plural subject strategy is needed for
capturing ways in which some people sometimes think.</p>
<p>We can take this one step further. Here is a way in which you and I
could become the plural subject of an intention. We each somehow become
convinced, however mistakenly, that you and I are the plural subjects of
an intention to cook dinner. This thought might influence our behaviour:
thinking, perhaps mistakenly, that having this intention means we are
subject to various norms, we might aim to act in ways that conform to
them. We are, by our lights, acting as if we had this intention. We
could also be taking for granted that we were plural subjects of a range
of other beliefs, desires and mental states, and perhaps explicitly
attributing some as our activity unfolds. And others, if they became
convinced, perhaps mistakenly, that we had this intention, might also
think and act accordingly. In this way, what began as merely a mistake
became real enough to shape the social world through being adopted as a
normative ideal.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In this section I have introduced the plural subject strategy and
offered a preliminary and superficial case for its theoretical
coherence. Following this strategy can lead to various quite different
theories. On some theories, the existence of plural subjects involves
long-term, intimate connections capable of supporting a shared mental
life. On other possible theories, plural subjects can be temporary
phenomena arising from the specific needs of a moment.</p>
<p>This falls short of showing that the plural subject strategy is
successful. For it to succeed, minimally there must be cases in which
the existence of plural subjects is actually what distinguishes joint
activities from things people do in parallel but merely individually.
(At least that is what one quite prominent approach requires, as we saw
in section <a href="#sec:background" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:background">3</a>.) I have tried to indicate the
difficulties involved in showing that no such cases could exist. But of
course we have not seen positive grounds to suppose that there are now,
or have ever been, any intentions (or other mental states) which do have
plural subjects. Following the approach of section <a
href="#sec:live-it-out" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:live-it-out">2</a>, the possibility that there is a
theoretically coherent plural subject theory which some people could aim
to live out is reason to accept that such a theory could capture an
aspect of shared intention.</p>
<p>For what it is worth, my own sense is that it would be quite hard to
establish, in practice, that a particular situation did involve a plural
subject, and that the difficulty of doing so may have been
underestimated. To illustrate, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Schmid:2008">Schmid (2008)</span> claims that plural agents
feature in common sense thinking. This claim is hard to evaluate because
other philosophers would probably reject it (<span class="citation"
data-cites="ludwig:2016_individual">(Ludwig 2016)</span>, perhaps).
Certainly philosophers seem vulnerable to making wrong assumptions about
common sense thinking in other cases <span class="citation"
data-cites="starmans:2012_folk nagel:2013_authentic starmans:2013_taking">(e.g.
Starmans and Friedman 2012, 2013; Nagel, Mar, and San Juan 2013)</span>.
One as yet unresolved challenge is to develop an operationalisation
which would enable us to distinguish someone thinking and acting in
terms of plural subjects from someone operating with a different
conception of shared intention. Whereas we have multiple methods for
identifying stated preferences (including contingent valuation and
choice modelling), we currently lack any hint about how we might
identify attitudes towards plural subjects. This challenge is made
harder by the need to distinguish plural subjects from aggregate
subjects.</p>
<h1 id="sec:aggregate">The Aggregate Subject Strategy</h1>
<p>An aggregate subject is a subject with proper parts which are
themselves subjects in their own right. If you have intentions and some
proper parts of you also have intentions of their own, then you are an
aggregate subject.</p>
<p>Although our interest is in subjects of intention, and of mental
states generally, a non-mental illustration may be helpful. The
Portuguese man o’war, <em>Physalia physalis</em>, is an animal composed
of polyps which are themselves born as animals in their own right. Why
is the man o’war an aggregate subject rather than a plural subject?
Because it is numerically distinct from the animals which compose it.
These may change over its lifetime. By contrast, in the case of a plural
subject, there is nothing that could continue to exist if one of the
individuals ceases to exist. A plural subject is not a thing at all: it
is just some individuals. An aggregate subject, even one which right now
consists of nothing but some individuals, is nevertheless a thing that
is logically distinct from the individuals which comprise it.</p>
<p>For a non-mental illustration which features both plural and
aggregate subjects, consider:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The protestors formed a barrier which blocked the
entrance.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Forming the barrier is something the protestors do collectively. They
(and no other thing) are the plural subject of the forming. But in
talking about the barrier we have introduced an aggregate entity.
Although it is composed of the protestors and nothing else, it is
numerically distinct from them. We know the barrier is distinct from the
protestors because one of the protestors might abandon the barrier and
be replaced by a new protestor.</p>
<p>Not everything true of an aggregate subject is true of a
corresponding plural subject, even when, as in the protestors’ case, the
only parts of the aggregate subject are the plural subject. For example,
the barrier may be capable of surviving an assault which would destroy
the plural subject. And, conversely, it is true that the plural subject
formed the barrier but false that the aggregate subject did so. The
mental case is similar. To be an aggregate subject, a thing must have
its own intentions (or other mental states) which are at least
potentially distinct from those of its parts <span class="citation"
data-cites="bjornsson:2017_corporate">(Björnsson and Hess 2017,
274)</span>.</p>
<p>How could there be aggregate subjects of intention? As List and
Pettit put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘Let a collection of individuals form and act on a single, robustly
rational body of attitudes [...] and it will be an agent.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Individuals sometimes act in this way only because their interests
are so closely aligned, as when a variety of finance professionals all
rush to exploit a tax loophole so that state finances appear ravaged by
a many-handed beast.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Alternatively, individuals may
authorise a representative to speak for them as a group. Such cases are
unlikely to be theoretically interesting given our aim of investigating
shared intention more broadly <span class="citation"
data-cites="list_pettit:2011">(List and Pettit 2011, 7ff)</span>.
Instead we should focus on cases where an aggregate agent has what
Sugden calls <em>autonomy</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An aggregate subject has autonomy if there is ‘the possibility that
every member of the group has an individual preference for y over x
(say, each prefers wine bars to pubs) while the group acts on an
objective that ranks x above y.’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="Sugden:2000mw">(Sugden 2000)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The challenge, then, is to explain how there can be aggregate
subjects which are autonomous from the subjects which compose them.</p>
<p>One approach to meeting this challenge borrows from decision theory.
It is possible to use decision theory as an ‘elucidation of the notions
of subjective probability [roughly, belief] and subjective desirability
or utility [roughly, desire]’ <span class="citation"
data-cites="Jeffrey:1983oe">(Jeffrey 1983, xi)</span>. Whether or not
there are other ways of elucidating attitudes, decision theory provides
one coherent way of thinking about them. But decision theory is also
agnostic about what subjects are. As long as a thing’s behaviour fits a
certain pattern, one that is specified by axioms linking attitudes to
actions, the thing can coherently be attributed preferences. This is why
decision theory and its derivatives can be applied not only in
describing humans but also bacteria, business organisations and
countries <span class="citation" data-cites="dixit:2014_games">(Dixit,
Skeath, and Reiley 2014, chap. 10)</span>. Being agnostic about what
subjects are makes it a useful tool for constructing a theory of
aggregate agents.</p>
<p>In essence, the construction goes like this.<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
Two or more individuals take themselves, rightly or wrongly, to be
components of an aggregate agent. These individuals each ascribe
preferences, and perhaps other attitudes, to the aggregate agent, and
they all ascribe the same attitudes. They then use these preferences to
rank combinations of individual actions, and each individual selects an
action from a highest-ranking combination. Given the usual axioms about
preferences being transitive and so on <span class="citation"
data-cites="steele:2020_decision">(Steele and Stefánsson 2020)</span>,
and given some background assumptions about the individuals’ knowledge
of their situation, it will be possible to use decision theory to model
the situation as if there were an aggregate agent. And if we follow
Jeffrey in taking decision theory as elucidating preference and other
attitudes, we can infer that there actually is an aggregate agent.
Further, because the preferences and other attitudes ascribed by the
individuals need not be their own, the aggregate agent has autonomy in
the above sense.</p>
<p>How might the aggregate subject strategy provide a notion of shared
intention? And how might it enable us to distinguish joint actions from
things people do in parallel but merely individually (see section <a
href="#sec:background" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:background">3</a>)? One possibility is to stipulate
that the intentions arrived at by individuals through the process of
determining how the aggregate agent will act comprise a shared intention
(<span class="citation" data-cites="Gold:2007zd">(Gold and Sugden
2007)</span>; alternative views are offered by <span class="citation"
data-cites="bardsley:2007_collective">(Bardsley 2007)</span> and <span
class="citation" data-cites="pacherie:2013_lite">(Pacherie
2013)</span>). On this view, one way for an activity to be genuinely
joint is for it to issue from reasoning about the preferences of an
aggregate subject where each reasoner is a part of that aggregate
subject.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>None of this shows, of course, that there actually are aggregate
subjects of preference or intention. Even assuming there are, we cannot
yet say whether their existence is actually what distinguishes joint
activities from things people do in parallel but merely individually. My
aim in this section was merely to defend the theoretical possibility of
aggregate subjects.</p>
<h1 id="sec:reductive">The Reductive Strategy</h1>
<p>If you seek to characterise shared intention entirely in terms of
ordinary, individual subjects and their ordinary, individual attitudes
then you are pursuing the reductive strategy.</p>
<p>Contemporary interest in the reductive strategy starts with <span
class="citation" data-cites="sellars:1963_imperatives">Sellars (1963,
203)</span>’s observation that statements to the effect that we intend
that we cook dinner are ‘clearly not the logical sum of’ statements
about each of us individually intending that we cook dinner (<span
class="citation" data-cites="tuomela_we-intentions_1988">(Tuomela and
Miller 1988)</span>). Apparently, then, our having a shared intention
that we cook dinner together cannot consist simply in our each intending
this. A natural question is whether there is any combination of
ordinary, individual intentions, knowledge states or other mental
attitudes our having which could be necessary or sufficient for us to
have a shared intention that we cook dinner.</p>
<p>The most extensively developed and widely discussed attempt to
provide sufficient conditions for shared intention is <span
class="citation" data-cites="bratman:2014_book">Bratman (2014)</span>’s.
The full account is complex but the core idea, put roughly, is this. For
us to have a shared intention that we cook dinner, it suffices that we
each intend that we cook dinner, that we intend to do so by way and
because of these intentions, and that this is all common knowledge among
us.</p>
<p>Proponents of the reductive strategy have succeeded in providing sets
of necessary or sufficient conditions which have intuitive pull for some
and against which none of the published counterexamples have been widely
accepted as successful. This is remarkable given that the model for
Bratman and several others is Grice’s analysis of meaning <span
class="citation" data-cites="Bratman:1992mi">(Bratman 1992, footnote 13
to p. 334)</span>, which met a different fate. A ‘flood’ of
counterexamples to Grice’s analysis led to extensive revisions, to which
further counterexamples were developed <span class="citation"
data-cites="searle:2007_grice">(Searle 2007, 11)</span>. Confidence in
the project’s eventual success was shaken when, in a dramatic change of
direction, Schiffer, who was formerly a leading proponent of the Gricean
analysis, argued that the whole project was based on a mistake. <a
href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> While Grice’s analysis has
continued to inspire various projects (<span class="citation"
data-cites="moore:2016_gricean">(Moore 2017)</span>, for example), we
are no closer to a successful reductive analysis. By contrast, generally
accepted counterexamples to reductive sets of necessary or sufficient
conditions for shared intention appear to be rare.</p>
<p>A diversity of views about the features of shared intentions can be
found in the reductive strategy. The various conditions proposed imply
conflicting views about whether having a shared intention invariably
involves dispositions to help (for: <span class="citation"
data-cites="bratman:2014_book">(Bratman 2014, 56–57)</span>; against:
<span class="citation" data-cites="Bratman:1992mi">(Bratman
1992)</span>, <span class="citation"
data-cites="ludwig_collective_2007">(Ludwig 2007)</span>), common
knowledge (for: <span class="citation"
data-cites="Bratman:1993je">(Bratman 1993)</span>; against: <span
class="citation" data-cites="blomberg:2015_common">(Blomberg
2016)</span>), and corresponding individual intentions on each subject’s
part (for: <span class="citation" data-cites="Bratman:1992mi">(Bratman
1992)</span>; against: <span class="citation"
data-cites="sellars:1963_imperatives">(Sellars 1963)</span>). There are
also further issues on which theorists could disagree, including on
whether shared intention invariably involves contralateral commitment
(for: <span class="citation" data-cites="gilbert:2009shared">(Gilbert
2009)</span>; against: <span class="citation"
data-cites="Roth:2004ki">(Roth 2004, 361)</span>), cooperation <span
class="citation"
data-cites="salomone-sehr:2022_cooperation">(Salomone-Sehr 2022)</span>
or nonobservational knowledge <span class="citation"
data-cites="roessler:2020_plural">(Roessler 2024)</span>.</p>
<p>This gives rise to a challenge to the reductive strategy. For the
diversity makes it unclear when proponents of the reductive strategy can
coherently be interpreted as offering competing attempts to characterise
a single thing and when as offering compatible attempts to characterise
different things.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>The reductive strategy allows us to construct many theories, each
internally theoretically coherent but inconsistent with other reductive
theories that share an explanandum. For any combination of views about
the features of shared intention, it would be possible to construct a
coherent reductive theory. If we simplify and regard the six features
mentioned above as binary, this yields 64 reductive theories. The
scarcity of counterexamples cuts two ways.</p>
<h1 id="the-limits-of-a-metatheoretical-principle">The Limits of a
Metatheoretical Principle</h1>
<p>We have seen that the three strategies each yield theoretically
coherent positions, and, further, that at least one of these strategies
alone yields many theoretically coherent positions. Can we decide
between the positions by invoking metatheoretical principles? This idea
has been carefully developed by Bratman:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘If we can get a plausible model of modest sociality without
appealing to a fundamental discontinuity in the step from individual
planning agency to such sociality, then there is a presumption against
an appeal to such a discontinuity in our theorising.’ <span
class="citation" data-cites="bratman:2014_book">(Bratman 2014,
36)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If true, this principle provides a good reason to prefer the
reductive strategy over theories like that of <span class="citation"
data-cites="Searle:1990em">Searle (1990)</span> and perhaps also that of
<span class="citation" data-cites="gilbert:2014_book">Gilbert
(2013)</span>.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> This is because each of those
theorists postulates a fundamental discontinuity. In Searle’s case, this
is a novel kind of attitude, the ‘we-intention’, which differs from
ordinary intention along the same dimension as desire differs from
intention.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> For her part, Gilbert postulates a
novel kind of commitment and associated nonmoral norms. The novel kinds
of intention and commitment are fundamental discontinuities.</p>
<p>Although Bratman’s metatheoretical principle rules against some
theories, it does not exclude many of those derived from the reductive
strategy. Nor does it exclude the plural and aggregate subject
strategies outright. After all, the whole point of plural subjects is
that they are nothing but some subjects <span class="citation"
data-cites="boolos:1984_value">(Boolos 1984)</span>. And the bare idea
of an aggregate subject is no more a fundamental discontinuity than is a
barrier composed of protestors. Further, as we have seen (in sections <a
href="#sec:plural" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:plural">4</a> and <a href="#sec:aggregate"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:aggregate">5</a>), both
plural subject and the aggregate subject strategies can be implemented
without appealing to fundamental discontinuities.</p>
<p>Apparently, then, Bratman’s metatheoretical principle is limited.
There are theories from each of the three strategies—plural, aggregate
and reductive—between which it fails to discriminate.</p>
<p>This is why I have presented the strategies in an unusual order. The
usual way is to start with the reductive strategy and then possibly to
justify adopting one of the others by some failure of that strategy
(see, for example, <span class="citation"
data-cites="helm_plural_2008">(Helm 2008)</span> ). In my view that is a
mistake. There is no consensus on attempts to demonstrate failure of the
reductive strategy generally. Quite the opposite: after three decades
there is not yet even a successful published counterexample to the most
widely discussed reductive theory (<span class="citation"
data-cites="Bratman:1992mi">(Bratman 1992)</span>; <span
class="citation" data-cites="bratman:2022_planning">(Bratman
2022b)</span>). But, equally, the mere absence of successful objections
to a theory is not enough to establish its truth. The plural and
aggregate subject strategies are significant not because the reductive
strategy can be shown to fail but because they also yield theoretically
coherent, as yet unfalsified theories.</p>
<p>These are deep waters. Some researchers hold that plural subjects
should be avoided if possible, even narrowly logical ones (see <span
class="citation" data-cites="ludwig:2016_individual">(Ludwig
2016)</span> cited in section <a href="#sec:plural"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:plural">4</a>). Some even
suggest that ‘all plural locutions should be paraphrased away’. <a
href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> Were this true, the plural subject
strategy might be ruled out for reasons not specifically psychological.
As this illustrates, the considerations offered here fall far short of
demonstrating that it would be impossible to find general principles
which do discriminate among the three strategies for shared
intention.</p>
<p>But there is also a positive argument for my thesis that all three
strategies are needed.</p>
<h1 id="sec:multiple-strategies">Do We Need Multiple Strategies for
Shared Intention?</h1>
<p>It is possible for people to intentionally live out one or another
theory of shared intention: to think and act as if that theory were true
of them. This indicates that no one theory alone could be sufficient to
fully characterise shared intention. Or so I will argue in this
section.</p>
<p>For each of the three strategies, there are recipes you and I could
explicitly aim to follow. To illustrate, suppose the time for us to face
the growing pile of dirty dishes in our kitchen has finally come. Having
both been inspired by <span class="citation"
data-cites="Schmid:2008">Schmid (2008)</span>, we might regard ourselves
as the plural subject of an intention to wash the dishes and act
accordingly (see section <a href="#sec:plural" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:plural">4</a>). Or perhaps what comes to mind is
instead an idea about ascribing preferences to an aggregate subject and
doing our parts to fulfill them (see section <a href="#sec:aggregate"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:aggregate">5</a>). Or
maybe we have both just been reading <span class="citation"
data-cites="bratman:2014_book">Bratman (2014)</span> and are impressed
that we could benefit by forming and making explicit the intentions he
identifies, thereby meeting his sufficient conditions for shared
intention (see section <a href="#sec:reductive"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:reductive">6</a>). This
being new to us, we even decide to write everything down so that we can
track the attitudes and actions. Things go well and we continue to use
the recipe for shared intention in our future activities. Over time our
use of the chosen recipe becomes so familiar that we hardly need to
think about it at all.</p>
<p>The possibility of our aiming to follow a recipe associated with any
one of the three strategies for shared intention, first explicitly and
then with greater skill, suggests that no one strategy can claim to be
uniquely correct. Instead, capturing the full range of phenomena
involving shared intention will require theories associated with several
different strategies.</p>
<p>The extent to which we actually succeed in following a recipe may be
quite limited, much as our stated preferences alone may explain only a
small part of our behaviour (see section <a href="#sec:live-it-out"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:live-it-out">2</a>). What
matters for our purposes, however, is just that the aim of living out
the theory is not entirely inert. It should influence some of our
thoughts and actions. This is what makes it reasonable to accept, in the
absence of overriding reasons, that the theory could be true of us.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to consider possible responses to this position.
One response starts with the observation that following a recipe
together may involve us having a shared intention to do so. Probably,
then, not all shared intention is a consequence of our intentionally
living out a theory of shared intention. We might therefore be motivated
to search for phylogenically or ontogenically foundational forms of
shared intention (see, for example, <span class="citation"
data-cites="Tollefsen:2005vh Rakoczy:2007ou pacherie:2013_lite">(Tollefsen
2005; Rakoczy and Tomasello 2007; Pacherie 2013)</span>). Perhaps it
would even be possible, eventually, to relate strategies and theories to
different stages and needs. This is a radical response which breaks from
the most extensively developed, best defended theories currently
available, which give no such importance to evolutionary or
developmental considerations.</p>
<p>An alternative response would aim to distinguish recipes that humans
actually follow, noting that these may be fewer than those which could
in principle be used.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> There are at least two potential
sources of inspiration for this response. One is narrowly philosophical
attempts to establish that aggregate or plural subjects of shared
intention are either practically indispensable or required for certain
explanatory purposes. (<span class="citation"
data-cites="roth:2014_indispensability">(Roth 2014)</span> presents both
kinds of argument, for example.) The other source of inspiration for
this response could be taken from <span class="citation"
data-cites="gomez-lavin:2019_normativity">Gomez-Lavin and Rachar
(2019)</span>, who offer findings which they interpret as showing that
everyday thinking involves distinctive features of <span
class="citation" data-cites="gilbert:2014_book">Gilbert (2013)</span>’s
account of shared intention. Just here we encounter a dilemma. Narrowly
philosophical arguments may establish that humans do follow one recipe
but appear unlikely to show that they do not also follow other recipes.
On the other hand, taking inspiration from experimental research
involves a radical departure from the kinds of consideration usually
taken to motivate a theory of shared intention. This is clear from
responses to <span class="citation"
data-cites="gomez-lavin:2019_normativity">Gomez-Lavin and Rachar
(2019)</span>’s work, which include <span class="citation"
data-cites="lohr:2022_recent">Löhr (2022)</span> who challenges their
interpretation on methodological grounds and <span class="citation"
data-cites="michael:2022_intuitions">Michael and Butterfill
(2022)</span> who offer apparently contrasting findings. Those authors’
interest in discovering how people actually think about joint activities
has no counterpart in the work of the leading philosophers.</p>
<p>A bolder and more orthodox response might be to allow that we could
coherently follow any of the recipes but deny that all of them yield
shared intention (or, more ambitiously, even that any do). The challenge
for proponents of this response is to identify grounds for rejecting the
view that following the recipes yields genuine shared intention. They
would need to enable all of us, as researchers, to know which things a
theory of shared intention should explain independently of our knowing
which theory is true. As things stand now, philosophers typically use
particular examples of joint activities to introduce the topic (see
section <a href="#sec:introduction" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:introduction">1</a>, and <span class="citation"
data-cites="bratman:2014_book">(Bratman 2014, 5–6)</span>, for example).
The usual assumption is that the examples are sufficient to identify
‘shared activity of the sort we are trying to understand’ <span
class="citation" data-cites="bratman:2014_book">(Bratman 2014,
6)</span>. But intentionally following one of the recipes is, of course,
one way of walking together, playing a piano duet, or painting a house
together. So if examples of joint activities provide us as researchers
with a common understanding of the things to be explained, that common
understanding supports the view that more than one strategy’s recipes
are needed to capture them. Opponents of this view need further
theory-independent ways of identifying what is to be explained.</p>
<p>Overall, it seems plausible that at least three different strategies
for shared intention are needed. This is because each of the plural,
aggregate and reductive strategies is associated with a recipe people
could intentionally follow and thereby manifest phenomena for
characterising which the corresponding strategy is needed.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I have explored three strategies for elucidating ideas about shared
intention. The plural, aggregate and reductive strategies are often
regarded as competing attempts to characterise a single target.
Proponents of the plural and aggregate subject strategies typically
object that the reductive strategies fail, while proponents of reductive
strategies aim to show that the other strategies are not needed (or, if
they are needed, that they can be tacked on to a reductive strategy; see
<a href="#sec:introduction" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:introduction">1</a>). Despite much effort, no such
arguments currently enable us to determine which strategy is correct. In
contrast, I have appealed to the possibility of intentionally living out
different theories to argue that for each strategy there are phenomena
which can be correctly characterised only by following that strategy
(section <a href="#sec:multiple-strategies" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:multiple-strategies">8</a>). There may also be many
theories derived from the reductive strategy for which the same is true
(section <a href="#sec:reductive" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:reductive">6</a>).</p>
<p>If correct, this conclusion marks a collective success. Whereas it
was initially assumed that at most one strategy would work, the careful
development of multiple theories by their various proponents suggests
there are multiple theoretically coherent possibilities, each having
intuitive appeal to some.</p>
<p>Despite the success, this conclusion is not a tenable stopping point.
Whereas progress surely requires that we can discover grounds to reject
some theories, the conclusion that we need multiple strategies seems to
imply that anything goes in constructing theories of shared
intention.</p>
<p>What to do? The conclusion that we need multiple strategies rests on
the premise that we need at least one theory of shared intention. One
way to avoid it might be to reject this premise (see footnote <a
href="#fn:no-shared-intention" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fn:no-shared-intention">2</a> on page for discussions
which may motivate considering this option). But while questioning the
premise may lead to fresh insights, the idea that we might completely do
away with theories of shared intention seems unpromising insofar as some
existing theories have been fruitfully applied beyond philosophy. <a
href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>A more hopeful response to the untenable conclusion would be to take
inspiration from other domains where multiple apparently incompatible
approaches have been discovered. We might draw a very inexact parallel
with the twin possibilities of using sets to replace plural
quantification and of using plural quantification to construct sets
<span class="citation" data-cites="linnebo:2022_plural">(Linnebo 2022,
sec. 4.3)</span>. Perhaps—so the hopeful response—we can show that the
strategies for shared intention yield theories which are in some sense
equivalent ways of elucidating a single set of ideas about shared
intention.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> Or perhaps the informal nature of
the theories and their diversity means that this response is just too
hopeful.</p>
<p>A simpler response is also available. Several researchers have
pointed to things which stand in need of explanation and which, they
suggest, might be explained using a theory of shared intention. These
include behavioural and neuroscientific findings <span class="citation"
data-cites="gallotti:2013_social">(Gallotti and Frith 2013)</span>,
patterns in cognitive development <span class="citation"
data-cites="Tomasello:2007gl">(Tomasello and Carpenter 2007)</span>, and
decision making <span class="citation"
data-cites="Sugden:2000mw">(Sugden 2000)</span>. In some cases this has
led to debate on which things theories of shared intention are supposed
to explain (see, for example, <span class="citation"
data-cites="bratman:2014_book">(Bratman 2014)</span> on <span
class="citation" data-cites="Gold:2007zd">(Gold and Sugden
2007)</span>). One way to make further progress would be, in offering a
theory about shared intention, to specify things which stand in need of
explanation in a way that can be understood independently of the
theory’s truth or falsity; and to formulate the theory in such a way
that makes it possible to determine, eventually, whether it does
actually explain those things.</p>
<p>To illustrate how this might go, consider a relatively easy family of
questions. How do various groups of individuals represent the activities
of some agents acting together in particular situations? Instead of
interpreting existing theories as claims about how shared intention is,
we can also interpret (or usefully misinterpret) them as theories about
how people represent situations involving shared intention. Generating
predictions from existing theories is difficult but there are signs that
this might be possible.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> Relative to this
project—that of discovering how individuals represent joint
activities—the existence of many theories is not a bad thing. After all,
there may well be differences between species, between infants, children
and adults, and between cultures. Further, a single individual may adopt
different models in different situations. Diversity in the theories of
shared intention may enable us to discover genuine diversity in the
things to be explained.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we researchers need, but lack, a common understanding
of what theories of shared intention are theories of. It has been
fruitful to construct different models of how aspects of shared
intention might be. The next step is to find out which models explain
which things.</p>

Title: Children’s Selective Learning from Others
Authors: Erika Nurmsoo, Elizabeth Robinson, and Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2010
Journal: Review of Philosophy and Psychology
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Psychological research into children's sensitivity to testimony has primarily focused on their ability to judge the likely reliability of speakers. However, verbal testimony is only one means by which children learn from others. We review recent research exploring children's early social referencing and imitation, as well as their sensitivity to speakers' knowledge, beliefs, and biases, to argue that children treat information and informants with reasonable scepticism. As children's understanding of mental states develops, they become ever more able to critically evaluate whether to believe new information.

Title: Cognitive Architecture of Belief Reasoning in Children and Adults: A Primer on the Two-Systems Account
Authors: Jason Low, Ian Apperly, Stephen A. Butterfill and Hannes Rakoczy
Year: 2016
Journal: Child Development Perspectives
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Characterizing the cognitive architecture of human mindreading 
forces us to address two puzzles in people’s attributions of belief:
why children show inconsistent expectations about others’ belief-based actions, and why adults’ belief reasoning is sometimes automatic and sometimes not. The seemingly puzzling data suggest humans have multiple mindreading systems that use different models of the mental. The efficient system is shared by infants, children and adults, and uses a minimal model of mind, which enables belief-like states to be tracked. The flexible system is late-developing and uses a canonical model, which incorporates propositional attitudes. A given model’s operation has signature limits that produce performance contrasts, in children as well as adults, between certain types of mindreading tasks

Title: Towards a Mechanistically Neutral Account of Acting Jointly: The Notion of a Collective Goal 
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill and Corrado Sinigaglia
Year: 2022
Journal: Mind
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Anyone who has ever walked, cooked or crafted with a friend is in a position to know that acting jointly is not just acting side-by-side.  But what distinguishes acting jointly from acting in parallel yet merely individually?  Four decades of philosophical research have yielded broad consensus on a strategy for answering this question.  This strategy is emph{mechanistically committed}; that is, it hinges on invoking states of the agents who are acting jointly (often dubbed ‘shared’, ‘we-’ or ‘collective’ intentions).  Despite the consensus, enduring disagreement remains. The disagreement may be a consequence of the strategy; at least this is plausible enough to motivate considering the prospects for an alternative. Our aim is therefore to draw attention to a coherent alternative that is present in the literature but often overlooked. This alternative is emph{mechanistically neutral}: it avoids invoking states of agents. Implementing the alternative, we introduce the notion of a collective goal and a characterisation of acting jointly which meets criteria standardly used in evaluating other accounts and may have some advantages over those accounts.

Title: Cue Competition Effects and Young Children's Causal and Counterfactual Inferences
Authors: Teresa McCormack, Stephen A. Butterfill, Christoph Hoerl and Patrick Burns
Year: 2009
Journal: Developmental Psychology
Type: Publication

## Abstract

The authors examined cue competition effects in young children using the blicket detector paradigm, in which objects are placed either singly or in pairs on a novel machine and children must judge which objects have the causal power to make the machine work. Cue competition effects were found in a 5- to 6-year-old group but not in a 4-year-old group. Equivalent levels of forward and backward blocking were found in the former group. Children's counterfactual judgments were subsequently examined by asking whether or not the machine would have gone off in the absence of 1 of 2 objects that had been placed on it as a pair. Cue competition effects were demonstrated only in 5- to 6-year-olds using this mode of assessing causal reasoning.

Title: Drawn Together: When Motor Representations Ground Joint Actions
Authors: Francesco della Gatta, Francesca Garbarini, Marco Rabuffetti, Luca Viganò, Stephen A. Butterfill and Corrado Sinigaglia
Year: 2017
Journal: Cognition
Type: Publication

## Abstract

What enables individuals to act together? Recent discoveries suggest that a variety of mechanisms are involved. But something fundamental is yet to be investigated. In joint action, agents represent a collective goal, or so it is often assumed. But how, if at all, are collective goals represented in joint action and how do such representations impact performance? To investigate this question we adapted a bimanual paradigm, the circle-line drawing paradigm, to contrast two agents acting in parallel with two agents performing a joint action. Participants were required to draw lines or circles while observing circles or lines being drawn. The findings indicate that interpersonal motor coupling may occur in joint but not parallel action. This suggests that participants in joint actions can represent collective goals motorically.

Title: Are There Signature Limits in Early Theory of Mind?
Authors: Ella Fizke, Stephen A. Butterfill, Lea van de Loo, Eva Reindl, and Rakoczy, Hannes
Year: 2017
Journal: Journal of Experimental Child Psychology
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Current theory-of-mind research faces the challenge of reconciling two sets of seemingly incompatible findings: Whereas children come to solve explicit verbal false belief (FB) tasks from around 4 years of age, recent studies with various less explicit measures such as looking time, anticipatory looking, and spontaneous behavior suggest that even infants can succeed on some FB tasks. In response to this tension, two-systems theories propose to distinguish between an early-developing system, tracking simple forms of mental states, and a later-developing system, based on fully developed concepts of belief and other propositional attitudes. One prediction of such theories is that the early-developing system has signature limits concerning aspectuality. We tested this prediction in two experiments. The first experiment showed (in line with previous findings) that 2- and 3-year-olds take into account a protagonist’s true or false belief about the location of an object in their active helping behavior. In contrast, toddlers’ helping behavior did not differentiate between true and false belief conditions when the protagonist’s belief essentially involved aspectuality. Experiment 2 replicated these findings with a more stringent method designed to rule out more parsimonious explanations. Taken together, the current findings are compatible with the possibility that early theory-of-mind reasoning is subject to signature limits as predicted by the two-systems account.

Title: Gaining Knowledge via Other Minds: Children's Flexible Trust in Others as Sources of Information
Authors: Elizabeth J. Robinson, Stephen A. Butterfill and Erika Nurmsoo
Year: 2011
Journal: British Journal of Developmental Psychology
Type: Publication

## Abstract

In five experiments, we examined 3- to 6-year-olds' understanding that they could gain knowledge indirectly from someone who had seen something they had not. Consistent with previous research, children judged that an informant, who had seen inside a box, knew its contents. Similarly, when an informant marked a picture to indicate her suggestion as to the content of the box, 3- to 4-year-olds trusted this more frequently when the informant had seen inside the box than when she had not. Going beyond previous research, 3- to 4-year-olds were also sensitive to informants' relevant experience when they had to look over a barrier to see the marked picture, or ask for the barrier to be raised. Yet when children had to elicit the informant's suggestion, rather than just consult a suggestion already present, even 4- to 5-year-olds were no more likely to do so when the informant had seen the box's content than when she had not, and no more likely to trust the well-informed suggestion than the uninformed one. We conclude that young children who can ask questions may not yet fully understand the process by which they can gain accurate information from someone who has the experience they lack.

Title: Goals and Targets: A Developmental Puzzle about Sensitivity to Others’ Actions
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2021
Journal: Synthese
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Sensitivity to others’ actions is essential for social animals like humans and a fundamental requirement for any kind of social cognition. Unsurprisingly, it is present in humans from early in the first year of life. But what processes underpin infants’ sensitivity to others’ actions? Any attempt to answer this question must solve twin puzzles about the development of goal tracking. Why does some, but not all, of infants’ goal tracking appear to be limited by their abilities to represent the observed action motorically at the time it occurs? And why does their sensitivity to action sometimes manifest itself differently in dishabituation, pupil dilation and anticipatory looking? Solving these twin puzzles is critical for understanding humans’ earliest sensitivity to others’ actions. After introducing the puzzles, this paper argues that solving them may require identifying multiple, distinct processes for tracking the targets and goals of actions.

Title: Infants' Representations of Causation (Commentary on Susan Carey, The Origin of Concepts)
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2011
Journal: Behavioral and Brain Sciences
Type: Publication

## Abstract

It is consistent with the evidence in The Origin of Concepts to conjecture that infants' causal representations, like their numerical representations, are not continuous with adults', so that bootstrapping is needed in both cases.

Title: Intention and Motor Representation in Purposive Action
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill and Corrado Sinigaglia
Year: 2014
Journal: Philosophy and Phenomenological Research
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Are there distinct roles for intention and motor representation in explaining the purposiveness of action? Standard accounts of action assign a role to intention but are silent on motor representation. The temptation is to suppose that nothing need be said here because motor representation is either only an enabling condition for purposive action or else merely a variety of intention. This paper provides reasons for resisting that temptation. Some motor representations, like intentions, coordinate actions in virtue of representing outcomes; but, unlike intentions, motor representations cannot feature as premises or conclusions in practical reasoning. This implies that motor representation has a distinctive role in explaining the purposiveness of action. It also gives rise to a problem: were the roles of intention and motor representation entirely independent, this would impair effective action. It is therefore necessary to explain how intentions interlock with motor representations. The solution, we argue, is to recognise that the contents of intentions can be partially determined by the contents of motor representations. Understanding this content-determining relation enables better understanding how intentions relate to actions.

Title: Interacting Mindreaders
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2012
Journal: Philosophical Studies
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Could interacting mindreaders be in a position to know things which they would be unable to know if they were manifestly passive observers? This paper argues that they could. Mindreading is sometimes reciprocal: the mindreader's target reciprocates by taking the mindreader as a target for mindreading. The paper explains how such reciprocity can significantly narrow the range of possible interpretations of behaviour where mindreaders are, or appear to be, in a position to interact. A consequence is that revisions and extensions are needed to standard theories of the evidential basis of mindreading. The view also has consequences for understanding how abilities to interact combined with comparatively simple forms of mindreading may explain the emergence, in evolution or development, of sophisticated forms of social cognition.

Title: Intuitions about Joint Commitment
Authors: John Michael and Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2022
Journal: Philosophical Psychology
Type: Publication

## Abstract

In what sense is commitment essential to joint action, and do the participants in a joint action themselves perceive commitment as essential? Attempts to answer this question have so far been hampered by clashes of intuition. Perhaps this is because the intuitions in question have mostly been investigated using informal methods only. To explore this possibility, we adopted a more formal approach to testing intuitions about joint action, sampling naïve participants’ intuitions about experimentally controlled scenarios. This approach did reveal patterns in participants’ responses which may hint at potential conceptual links between commitment and joint action. It did not however provide evidence to support the view that commitment is essential to joint action, at least not from the agents’ own perspective. We conclude that intuitions alone, even when drawn systematically from a large sample, may be a poor basis for theorizing about joint action.

Title: Joint Action and Development
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2011
Journal: Philosophical Quarterly
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Given the premise that joint action plays some role in explaining how humans come to understand minds, what could joint action be? Not what a leading account, Michael Bratman&#39;s, says it is. For on that account engaging in joint action involves sharing intentions and sharing intentions requires much of the understanding of minds whose development is supposed to be explained by appeal to joint action. This paper therefore offers an account of a different kind of joint action, an account compatible with the premise about development. The new account is no replacement for the leading account; rather the accounts characterise two kinds of joint action. Where the kind of joint characterised by the leading account involves shared intentions, the new account characterises a kind of joint action involving shared goals.

      "x1-20001"></a>The Question</h3><!--l. 54-->

      <p class="noindent">On the assumption that joint action plays some role in
      explaining how humans develop an understanding of minds, what could joint action
      be? This question needs a little background. It is quite widely agreed that human
      adults reflections on thoughts and actions, their own and others, involve a range
      of commonsense psychological concepts including belief, desire, intention,
      knowledge and perception. Childrens abilities to deploy these concepts improve in
      fluency and sophistication over more than three years (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_610">Bartsch &amp; Wellman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_610">1995</a>). Several
      psychologists have claimed that children first engage in joint action from around
      their first birthday and that engaging in joint action facilitates these early
      improvements (<a href="#Xen_1198">Moll &amp; Tomasello</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1198">2007</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1421">Tomasello &amp;
      Carpenter</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1421">2007</a>;&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1090">Tomasello et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1090">2005</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_557">Tomasello &amp;
      Rakoczy</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_557">2003</a>). Joint actions that young children
      engage in include tidying up the toys together (<a href="#Xen_1204">Behne
      et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1204">2005</a>), cooperatively pulling handles
      in sequence to make a dog-puppet sing (<a href="#Xen_1679">Brownell
      et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1679">2006</a>), bouncing a ball on a large
      trampoline together (<a href="#Xen_1421">Tomasello &amp;
      Carpenter</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1421">2007</a>) and pretending to row a boat
      together. The psychologists claim that engaging in joint actions like these plays
      some role in the early development of abilities to use concepts like belief,
      desire, intention, knowledge and perception, and in the development of higher
      forms of cognition more generally. My question is what joint action could be
      given that some version of this claim is true.</p><!--l. 56-->

      <p class="indent">The question arises because a leading account of joint action,
      Michael Bratman's, is incompatible with the premise. To anticipate what is
      explained in detail below, on the leading account engaging in joint action
      requires sharing intentions, and sharing intentions requires abilities to engage
      in reasoning about propositional attitudesreasoning of just the sort whose
      development was supposed to be explained by engaging in joint action. So if the
      leading account were the whole truth about joint action, engaging in joint action
      would presuppose, and therefore could not explain, much of the development of
      reasoning about others mental states. Given that the premise is true, the leading
      account cannot be the whole truth about joint action. We need a further account
      of joint action, one that is compatible with the premise that joint action plays
      a role in explaining how humans develop abilities to think about minds and
      actions. Sections 4 to 8 provide such an account. Before that, Section 2 outlines the
      leading account of joint action and Section 3 explains why this account is
      incompatible with the premise about development. <a id="x1-2001r2" name=

      "x1-30002"></a>What is joint action? The leading account</h3><!--l. 61-->

      <p class="noindent">Philosophers paradigm cases of joint action include painting
      the house together (Michael Bratman), lifting a heavy sofa together (David
      Velleman), preparing a hollandaise sauce together (John Searle), going to Chicago
      together (Christopher Kutz), and walking together (Margaret Gilbert). One aim of
      an account of joint action is to identify features of some or all of these cases
      in virtue of which they count as joint actions. In this paper I focus on Michael
      Bratman's account because, despite the clarity of its presentation, no decisive
      objection to the parts of his account outlined below has yet been published, and
      also because this account has been most influential in psychology.<span class=
      "footnote-mark"><a href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk" name="fn1x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a id="x1-3001f1" name="x1-3001f1"></a></p>
      <!--l. 71-->

      <p class="indent">Bratman characterises a kind of joint action he calls shared
      intentional activity, which is activity explainable by shared
      intention.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn2x0" id="fn2x0-bk" name=
      "fn2x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a id="x1-3002f2" name=
      "x1-3002f2"></a> This immediately leads to the question of what shared intentions
      are. Bratman's answer has two parts, a specification of the functional role shared
      intentions play and a substantial account of what shared intentions could be. On
      the first part, Bratman stipulates that the functional role of shared intentions
      is to:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 74-->

        <p class="noindent">(i) coordinate activities; (ii) coordinate planning; and
        (iii) provide a framework to structure bargaining (<a href=
        "#Xen_1356">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1356">1993</a>, p.&nbsp;99).</p>
      </div><!--l. 77-->

      <p class="noindent">To illustrate: if we share an intention that we cook dinner,
      this shared intention will (iii) structure bargaining insofar as we may need to
      decide what to cook or how to cook it on the assumption that we are cooking it
      together; the shared intention will also require us to (ii) coordinate our
      planning by each bringing complementary ingredients and tools, and to (i)
      coordinate our activities by preparing the ingredients in the right order.</p>
      <!--l. 79-->

      <p class="indent">Given this claim about what shared intentions are for, Bratman
      argues that the following three conditions are collectively
      sufficient<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn3x0" id="fn3x0-bk" name=
      "fn3x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a id="x1-3003f3" name=
      "x1-3003f3"></a> for you and I to have a shared intention that we J. This is his
      substantial account of what shared intentions could be:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 83-->

        <p class="noindent">1. (a) I intend that we J and (b) you intend that we J</p>
        <!--l. 85-->

        <p class="noindent">2. I intend that we J in accordance with and because of la,
        lb, and meshing subplans of la and lb; you intend that we J in accordance with
        and because of la, lb, and meshing subplans of la and lb</p><!--l. 87-->

        <p class="noindent">3. 1 and 2 are common knowledge between us (<a href=

      </div><!--l. 90-->

      <p class="noindent">In arguing that these are collectively sufficient conditions
      for shared intention, Bratman combines two strategies. He argues that these
      conditions collectively suffice to rule out certain cases where, intuitively,
      there is no shared intention (such as the case where we each intend to paint the
      house, I yellow and you blue). And he argues that the attitudes specified in
      these conditions are collectively capable of playing the three roles shared
      intentions are supposed to play. <a id="x1-3004r3" name="x1-3004r3"></a></p>

      "x1-40003"></a>Why shared intentional activity could not significantly foster an
      understanding of minds</h3><!--l. 96-->

      <p class="noindent">Suppose that joint action plays a role in explaining the
      early development of childrens abilities to think about minds. Is Michael
      Bratman's shared intentional activity a notion of joint action which could play
      this role? Several psychologists have suggested that it is. Thus Moll and
      Tomasello explicate their hypothesis that the unique aspects of human cognition
      were driven by, or even constituted by social cooperation (<a href=
      "#Xen_1198">2007</a>, p.&nbsp;3) by appeal to a modified version of Bratman's
      (1992) definition of shared cooperative activities [on which] the participants in
      the cooperative activity share a joint goal (<a href="#Xen_1198">2007</a>,
      p.&nbsp;3); in this context share a joint goal means possess a shared intention.
      Similarly, Carpenter, in a discussion of joint action in infancy, writes:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 99-->

        <p class="noindent">I will adopt Bratman's (1992) influential formulation of
        joint action [F]or an activity to be considered shared or joint each partner
        needs to intend to perform the joint action together in accordance with and
        because of meshing subplans (p. 338) and this needs to be common knowledge
        between the participants. (<a href="#Xen_1682">Carpenter</a>&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_1682">2009</a>, p.&nbsp;281)</p>
      </div><!--l. 102-->

      <p class="noindent">Others who appeal to Bratman's notion of shared intentional
      activity in characterising childrens first joint actions and their role in
      development include <a href="#Xen_1090">Tomasello et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;(<a href=
      "#Xen_1090">2005</a>, p.&nbsp;680) and <a href=
      "#Xen_1365">Gr&acirc;&euro;&deg;fenhain et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;(<a href=
      "#Xen_1365">2009</a>, p.&nbsp;1430).</p><!--l. 104-->

      <p class="indent">Recall that shared intentional activity requires shared
      intentions. On Bratman's substantial account, sharing intentions requires having
      intentions about intentions and even intentions about subplans of intentions (see
      Condition 2 in the quote on the preceding page). Bratman emphasises this feature
      of the account:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 107-->

        <p class="noindent">each agent does not just intend that the group perform the
        [] joint action. Rather, each agent intends as well that the group perform this
        joint action in accordance with subplans (of the intentions in favor of the
        joint action) that mesh (<a href="#Xen_1197">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_1197">1992</a>, p.&nbsp;332).</p>
      </div><!--l. 110-->

      <p class="noindent">A natural thought at this point is that joint action might
      require only plans which <span class="cmti-12">in fact</span> mesh rather than
      <span class="cmti-12">intentions about</span> the meshing of plans. Bratman
      considers this option and explains why this weakening of his account is not
      coherent (<a href="#Xen_1197">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1197">1992</a>,
      pp.&nbsp;331-3), so I shall not pursue this thought.</p><!--l. 112-->

      <p class="indent">The fact that shared intentions require intentions about
      intentions suggests a potential objection to the view that shared intentional
      activity explains early developments in childrens abilities to think about minds.
      For it seems unlikely that 2- and 3-year-olds, who according to many findings are
      years away from being able to ascribe any propositional attitudes at
      all,<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn4x0" id="fn4x0-bk" name=
      "fn4x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a id="x1-4001f4" name=
      "x1-4001f4"></a> can form intentions about others intentions.<span class=
      "footnote-mark"><a href="#fn5x0" id="fn5x0-bk" name="fn5x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">5</sup></a></span><a id="x1-4002f5" name="x1-4002f5"></a> This
      would mean they cannot meet the sufficient conditions Bratman lays out for
      sharing intentions.</p><!--l. 123-->

      <p class="indent">This potential objection is weak because it depends on
      controversial empirical claims about the absolute time in development at which
      abilities to ascribe, and to form intentions about, intentions might emerge. A
      more promising objection avoids this dependence. The ability to form intentions
      about intentions involves a sophisticated kind of propositional attitude
      ascription (as explained below). This ability is required for sharing intentions
      in accordance with Bratman's substantial account. So meeting the sufficient
      conditions for joint action given by this account could not significantly
      <span class="cmti-12">explain</span> the development of an understanding of minds
      because it already <span class="cmti-12">presupposes</span> too much
      sophistication in the use of psychological concepts.<span class=
      "footnote-mark"><a href="#fn6x0" id="fn6x0-bk" name="fn6x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">6</sup></a></span><a id="x1-4003f6" name="x1-4003f6"></a></p>
      <!--l. 125-->

      <p class="indent">Note that, as it stands, this objection does not establish
      much. It concerns conditions imposed by the substantial account of shared
      intention which are sufficient but not necessary conditions.<span class=
      "footnote-mark"><a href="#fn7x0" id="fn7x0-bk" name="fn7x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">7</sup></a></span><a id="x1-4004f7" name="x1-4004f7"></a> The
      substantial account is supposed to characterise oneperhaps one among manyways in
      which the functional role of shared intentions can be realised. So the objection
      serves only to raise a question. Are there in fact alternative sufficient
      conditions for shared intention, conditions that can be met without already
      having abilities to use psychological concepts whose development was supposed to
      be explained by joint action?</p><!--l. 131-->

      <p class="indent">The answer to this question is not entirely straightforward. We
      must begin with the functional roles of shared intention, for these provide
      necessary conditions. One of the roles of shared intentions is to coordinate
      planning. What does coordinating planning involve? Intuitively the idea is that
      just as individual intentions serve to coordinate an individuals planning over
      time, so shared intentions coordinate planning between agents. (I use the terms
      individual intention and individual goal to refer to intentions and goals
      explanatory of individual actions; an individual action is an action performed by
      just one agent such as that described by the sentence Ayesha repaired the
      puncture all by herself.) A second role for shared intentions is to structure
      bargaining concerning plans. To understand these roles it is essential to
      understand what planning means in this context. The term planning is sometimes
      used quite broadly to encompass processes involved in low-level control over the
      execution of sequences of movements, as is often required for manipulating
      objects manually (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1535">Haggard</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1535">1998</a>), as well as processes controlling the movements of a limb
      on a single trajectory (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1681">Bizzu</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1681">2001</a>). In Bratman's account and this paper, the term planning is
      used in a narrower sense. Planning in this narrow sense exists to coordinate an
      agents various activities over relatively long intervals of time; it involves
      practical reasoning and forming intentions which may themselves require further
      planning, generating a hierachy of plans and subplans. Paradigm cases include
      planning a birthday party or planning to move house.</p><!--l. 133-->

      <p class="indent">Given the functional roles of shared intention, when (if ever)
      must the states which realise shared intentions include intentions about others
      intentions? Coordinating plans with others does not seem always or in principle
      to require specific intentions about others intentions. It is plausible that in
      everyday life some of our plans are coordinated largely thanks to a background of
      shared preferences, habits and conventions. Consider, for example, people who
      often meet in a set place at a fixed time of day to discuss research over lunch.
      These people can coordinate their lunch plans merely by setting a date and
      following established routine; providing nothing unexpected happens, they seem
      not to need intentions about each others intentions. Within limits, then,
      coordinating plans may not always require intentions about intentions. The same
      may hold for structuring bargaining. But when the background of shared
      preferences, habits and conventions is not sufficient to ensure that our plans
      will be coordinated, it is necessary to monitor or manipulate others plans. And
      since intentions are the basic elements of plans (in the special sense of plan in
      terms of which Bratman defined shared intention), this means monitoring or
      manipulating others intentions. The background which makes for effortlessly
      coordinated planning is absent when our aims are sufficiently novel, when the
      circumstances sufficiently unusual (as in many emergencies), and when our
      co-actors are sufficiently unfamiliar. In all of these cases, coordinating plans
      and structuring bargaining will involve monitoring or manipulating others
      intentions. Now this does not necessarily involve forming intentions about their
      intentions because, in principle, monitoring and manipulating others intentions
      could (within limits) be achieved by representing states which serve as proxies
      for intentions rather than by representing intentions as such, much as one can
      (within limits) monitor and manipulate others visual perceptions by representing
      their lines of sight. But possession of general abilities to monitor and
      manipulate others intentions does require being able to form intentions about
      others intentions.</p><!--l. 135-->

      <p class="indent">The question was whether there are sufficient conditions for
      shared intention which do not presuppose abilities to use psychological concepts
      whose development is supposed to be explained by joint action. As promised, the
      answer is not straightforward. In a limited range of cases, coordinating plans
      and perhaps structuring bargaining does not appear to require insights into other
      minds. But in other cases, particularly cases involving novel aims or agents
      unfamiliar with each other, intentions about others intentions are generally
      required.</p><!--l. 137-->

      <p class="indent">The main question for this section was whether Bratman's account
      captures a notion of joint action suitable for explaining the early development
      of childrens abilities to think about minds. Some of the joint actions which
      young children engage in involve novel aims, and some involve unfamiliar
      partners. So if these joint actions did involve coordinating planning and
      structuring bargaining, they could not rest on a shared background but would
      require abilities to form intentions about others intentions. It follows that
      joint action would presuppose much of the sophistication in the use of
      psychological concepts whose development it was supposed to explain. So given the
      premise that joint action plays a role in explaining early developments in
      understanding minds, it cannot be the case that the joint actions children engage
      in as soon as they engage in any joint actions involve shared intentions as
      characterised by Bratman.</p><!--l. 139-->

      <p class="indent">This conclusion rests on the assumption that having intentions
      about intentions involves some of the psychological sophistication whose
      development is supposed to be explained by appeal to joint action. One might
      object that the ability for form intentions about intentions is somehow less
      sophisticated than abilities to form other kinds of representation of other kinds
      of mental states. To answer the objection it is sufficient to clarify what
      intention means in this context. For the term intention, like planning, is used
      to mean different things by different researchers. Sometimes intention and goal
      are used interchangeably in describing behaviour which is somewhat flexibly
      organised around some outcome (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1433">Premack</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1433">1990</a>, p.&nbsp;14). But in
      this context we need a different notion of intention, one on which intentions are
      elements of plans. Such intentions play a role in coordinating an agents
      activities over time. Their role is characterised in part by normative
      constraints expressed in terms of the propositional contents of intentions. For
      instance, one norm characteristic of the role of intentions in plans requires an
      agent to avoid ways of realising one intention that will make it impossible for
      her to realise other intentions she has (all things being equal). This norm
      requires someone who intends both to visit an aunt and to buy some shoes in a
      single evening to limit time spent on each activity to allow for the other.
      Another norm characteristic of intention concerns the compatibility of having
      multiple intentions simultaneously: it is not rational to have multiple
      intentions unless it is rational to have a single intention agglomerating them
      all (<a href="#Xen_1543">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1543">1987</a>). Norms
      such as these, together with the role of intentions in practical reasoning, are
      what characterise the role of intentions in planning. Given that intentions are
      characterised in this way as elements in plans, it seems necessary that
      understanding intentions will involve some grasp both of the role that intentions
      as propositional attitudes play in practical reasoning and also of the norms
      relating intentions to planning. Of course this does not mean that individuals
      who understand intentions as elements in plans can articulate or list the
      relevant roles or norms. But it does mean that they should sometimes be sensitive
      to some of the requirements these norms impose and also that they would be able
      to recognise some of the norms as correct in optimal conditions. This is why
      requiring intentions about intentions presupposes significant psychological
      sophistication.</p><!--l. 141-->

      <p class="indent">Given that joint action facilitates the development of mental
      understanding, and that (as just argued) Bratman's notion of shared intentional
      activity is not a kind of joint action which could play this role, does it follow
      that Bratman's account is incorrect?<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn8x0"
      id="fn8x0-bk" name="fn8x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">8</sup></a></span><a id="x1-4005f8" name="x1-4005f8"></a>
      Drawing this conclusion would require the further assumption that there is just
      one kind of joint action. This is not obviously true. Compare individual action.
      It is sometimes accepted that there is a distinction between intentional action
      and other kinds of action such as response behaviours and merely purposive
      activities (<a href="#Xen_496">Dickinson &amp; Balleine</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_496">2000</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_194">Frankfurt</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_194">1971</a>). Because there may be an analogous distinction between kinds
      of joint action, the developmental considerations do not directly bear on the
      correctness of Bratman's account. Perhaps what we need is not a modified version
      of Bratman's account but an account of a different kind of joint action.</p>
      <!--l. 143-->

      <p class="indent">To sum up, Bratman's account does not characterise a kind of
      joint action which could play a role in explaining how children come to
      understand minds. In the next section I consider whether this undermines the
      claim that the interactions highlighted by developmental psychologists are really
      joint actions before offering a new account of joint action in the following
      sections. <a id="x1-4006r4" name="x1-4006r4"></a></p>

      <!--l. 149-->

      <p class="noindent">The argument of the previous section establishes that not all
      of the following claims are true:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 152-->

        <p class="noindent">(1) joint action fosters an understanding of minds;</p>
        <!--l. 154-->

        <p class="noindent">(2) all joint action involves shared intention; and</p>
        <!--l. 156-->

        <p class="noindent">(3) a function of shared intention is to coordinate two or
        more agents plans.</p>
      </div><!--l. 159-->

      <p class="noindent">These claims are inconsistent because if the second and third
      were both true, abilities to engage in joint action would presuppose, and so
      could not significantly foster, an understanding of minds. For all that has been
      said so far, any of these claims could be rejected. In what follows I
      characterise a form of joint action which involves what I call shared goals and
      no shared intentions. The aim is to show by construction that there are forms of
      joint action which require minimal cognitive sophistication. In doing this I
      shall provide grounds for rejecting the claim that joint action always involves
      shared intention, (2), strengthening the case for accepting the premise about
      development, (1), while remaining neutral on whether shared intentions function
      to coordinate planning, (3).</p><!--l. 161-->

      <p class="indent">Some researchers assert that all joint actions involve shared
      intentions. For instance, Tomasello writes that [t]he sine qua non of
      collaborative action is a joint goal and a joint commitment (<a href=
      "#Xen_1828">2008</a>, p.&nbsp;181). Here joint goal refers to shared intention in
      Bratman's sense and collaborative action includes joint actions early in
      development. Similarly, Gilbert writes I take collective action to involve a
      collective intention (<a href="#Xen_1287">2006</a>, p.&nbsp;5). Perhaps, then, a
      better strategy than the one I propose would be to reject the first claim, (1),
      above and conjecture that joint action cannot significantly foster an
      understanding of minds (although some lesser form of interaction may do so). But
      it is striking that none of the researchers who assert that all joint action
      involves shared intention provide an argument, and narrowly semantic
      considerations provide no support for this assertion (<a href=
      "#Xen_2394">Ludwig</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_2394">2007</a>;&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_2395">Smith</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_2395">2011</a>, p.&nbsp;367). In fact
      other researchers have assumed without argument that not all joint actions
      involve shared intention (<a href="#Xen_1197">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1197">1992</a>, p.&nbsp;330; <a href="#Xen_1860">Schmidt

      "#Xen_1778">Vesper et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1778">2010</a>). On what
      grounds could we accept this assumption or its negation?</p><!--l. 165-->

      <p class="indent">Let us step back. What features other than shared intention
      indicate that the actions of two or more agents constitute a joint action as
      opposed to any other kind of interaction? Here are several indicators of joint
      action:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 168-->

        <p class="noindent">i. this case seems to fit with paradigm examples of joint
        action such as walking, cooking or playing the piano together (<a href=
        "#Xen_1861">Gilbert</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1861">1990</a>;&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_2392">Goebl &amp; Palmer</a>&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_2392">2009</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_25">Velleman</a>&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_25">2000</a>);</p><!--l. 170-->

        <p class="noindent">ii. the candidate joint action differs from a case in which
        the agents perform the same type of activity (such as walking or cooking) in
        parallel rather than together (<a href="#Xen_1768">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_1768">2009</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1861">Gilbert</a>&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_1861">1990</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1365">Gr&acirc;&euro;&deg;fenhain
        et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1365">2009</a>, p.&nbsp;150);</p>
        <!--l. 172-->

        <p class="noindent">iii. for each agent, acting together rather than
        individually is voluntary in this sense: in so far as they control which means
        they adopt in pursuing a goal, such as whether to move an object by lifting it
        or by dragging it, they can also control whether their actions are individual
        or joint;</p><!--l. 174-->

        <p class="noindent">iv. there is a sense in which all of the agents actions
        taken together are directed to a single goal, and this is not just a matter of
        each agents action being individually directed to that goal;</p><!--l. 176-->

        <p class="noindent">v. there is a description of the interaction with a plural
        subject and an action verb, such as they are bouncing the ball on the
        trampoline (<a href="#Xen_1290">Kutz</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1290">2000</a>
        emphasises this indicator);</p><!--l. 178-->

        <p class="noindent">vi. each agent is disposed to modify her actions in
        accordance with what is needed to achieve the goal given how the other agents
        actions are unfolding (<a href="#Xen_1197">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_1197">1992</a>, p.&nbsp;328).</p>
      </div><!--l. 181-->

      <p class="noindent">I am not suggesting that any of these features is necessary
      for joint action, nor that they are collectively sufficient. My claim is just
      these features are relevant to deciding whether an interaction is a joint action,
      and that where an interaction has many or all of these features we have
      (defeasible) grounds to infer that it is a joint action. In short, I propose
      that, in the absence of a deeper analysis, we should take these features as a
      rough and provisional explication of one theoretically significant way of using
      the term joint action.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn9x0" id="fn9x0-bk"
      name="fn9x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">9</sup></a></span><a id="x1-5001f9"
      name="x1-5001f9"></a></p><!--l. 183-->

      <p class="indent">So what about the objection that all joint action involves
      shared intention? The following will provide (defeasible) grounds for rejecting
      it. For I shall show that some interactions have the features listed above,
      (i)-(vi), but do not involve shared intention. <a id="x1-5002r5" name=
      "x1-5002r5"></a></p>

      <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.</span> <a id="x1-60005" name=
      "x1-60005"></a>Plural activities</h3><!--l. 189-->

      <p class="noindent">Our question is what joint action could be on the assumption
      that it fosters an understanding of minds. We have seen (in Section 3) that the
      answer cannot involve appeal to shared intention. Joint actions involving shared
      intention presuppose, and so cannot significantly foster the development of,
      sophisticated uses of psychological concepts. What we need, then, is to identify
      a form of joint action that requires as little psychological sophistication as
      possible; by presupposing less we make it possible to explain more.</p>
      <!--l. 191-->

      <p class="indent">I shall approach this task indirectly by first considering
      forms of action involving multiple agents more basic than any kind of joint
      action. Some ants harvest plant hair and fungus in order to build traps to
      capture large insects; once captured, many worker ants sting the large insects,
      transport them and carve them up (<a href="#Xen_1292">Dejean
      et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1292">2005</a>). The ants behaviours have an
      interesting feature distinct from their being coordinated: each ants behaviours
      are individually organised around an outcomethe flys deathwhich occurs as a
      common effect of many ants behaviours. We can say that there is a single
      activitykilling a flywhich several ants performed. In general, a plural activity
      is one involving two or more agents. As I shall use the term plural activity, for
      agents to be engaged in a plural activity it is sufficient that each agents
      activities are individually organised around a single outcome which occurs as a
      common effect of all the agents activities.</p><!--l. 193-->

      <p class="indent">Note that nothing controversial is assumed in stating these
      sufficient conditions for plural activity. The first ingredient is the notion
      that an individuals behaviours can be organised around an outcome. This is
      shorthand for an open-ended disjunction of cases; it means that there is an
      intention, habit, biological function or other behaviour-organizing circumstance
      connecting the individuals behaviours to the outcome. The second ingredient is
      the notion of a common effect, which is not specific to action. The flys capture
      is a common effect of the ants individual behaviours in just the sense that the
      flys death is a common effect of the multiple doses of poison it received: none
      of the doses was individually deadly, each had its murderous effect only in
      concert with some of the others. As characterised here, the notion of a plural
      activity depends on nothing more controversial than the cogency of these two
      ingredients.</p><!--l. 195-->

      <p class="indent">My use of the term plural activity is different from other
      natural uses of this term and may be too broad to pick out an intuitive category.
      If Helen and Ayesha individually aim to smooth a section of pavement by shuffling
      their feet when they walk over it and if it does become smooth partly as a
      consequence of both their efforts, then they are engaged in the plural activity
      of smoothing the pavement. This is true even in the absence of any intention to
      act together. It is true even if their lives do not overlap at all, so that there
      may be no intuitive sense in which their smoothing the pavement is a joint
      action. Allowing this case to count as a plural activity does no harm for present
      purposes and makes it possible to characterise a useful notion of plural activity
      in uncontroversial terms.</p><!--l. 197-->

      <p class="indent">Another potentially unnatural feature of this definition of
      plural activity is that it requires success. By definition, where two or more
      agents actions constitute a plural activity the outcome to which they are
      directed must occur. This simplifies the definition in ways that will shortly be
      useful.</p><!--l. 199-->

      <p class="indent">Humans sometimes perform activities that are plural in the
      minimal sense that some ants behaviours are. In a particularly sulky mood Thomas
      pulls on one end of a large boat in order to move it; he does not realise that
      Illaria is pushing the other end and that without her contribution the boat would
      not move. He succeeds in moving the boat, as does Illaria. So there is a single
      activitymoving the boatwhich they both perform. Even though Thomas action is
      goal-directed (its goal is to move the boat to the sea), his activity is plural
      only in the minimal sense that the ants fly-trapping behaviour is: it is
      organised around an outcome which occurs as a common effect. The plural nature of
      such activities need not show up in intentions, desires or beliefs. That an
      activity is performed by two individuals does not require that they intend,
      believe or desire this to be so.</p><!--l. 201-->

      <p class="indent">What most philosophers mean by joint action is not, or not
      only, this minimal notion of plural activity. Certainly this minimal notion is
      inadequate for our present purpose, which is to understand what joint action
      could be on the assumption that it plays some role in explaining how children
      come to understand minds. Nevertheless, the notion of plural activity is a useful
      starting point for understanding a kind of joint action relevant to explaining
      development. <a id="x1-6001r6" name="x1-6001r6"></a></p>

      <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.</span> <a id="x1-70006" name=
      "x1-70006"></a>What is the function of shared goals?</h3><!--l. 206-->

      <p class="noindent">In giving an account of one kind of joint action I shall
      first identify something I call shared goals. Before starting it will be helpful
      to fix terminology. As I use the term goal it refers to an outcome, actual or
      possible, and not to a state. I make no direct use of the notion that agents can
      have goals (as in Sams goal was to topple the president) and focus on relations
      between goals and actions (as in the goal of Marvins action was to upset Ayesha).
      An action is <span class="cmti-12">goal-directed</span> where it makes sense to
      ask which of its possible and actual outcomes are goals to which the action was
      directed. One paradigm case of goal-directed action involves intention: where an
      agent acts on an intention, the intentions content specifies a goal to which her
      action is directed. In addition, an action can arguably be directed to a goal
      which is not specified in the content of any of the agents intentions (<a href=
      "#Xen_1359">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1359">1984</a>). There may also be
      forms of action which are goal-directed but do not involve intention at
      all.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn10x0" id="fn10x0-bk" name=
      "fn10x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">10</sup></a></span><a id="x1-7001f10"
      name="x1-7001f10"></a> Certainly there are ways of representing actions as
      goal-directed which do not involve representing intentions or any other
      propositional attitudes of agents.</p><!--l. 208-->

      <p class="indent">The term shared is used loosely. Just as, on most accounts,
      shared intentions are neither literally intentions nor literally shared (no
      single intention is mine and yours), so shared goals are not goals (they are
      complexes of states and relations) and do not by definition alone involve
      anything which is literally shared. I have used the otherwise infelicitous label
      shared goal in order to highlight the basic intuition behind the positive account
      of joint action I shall offer: some cases of joint action involve structures
      which bind not the agents intentions but the goals to which their activities are
      directed.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn11x0" id="fn11x0-bk" name=
      "fn11x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">11</sup></a></span><a id="x1-7002f11"
      name="x1-7002f11"></a></p><!--l. 210-->

      <p class="indent">Having fixed terminology we can now turn to the primary issue,
      which is to identify shared goals. Following the model provided by Bratman's
      account of shared intentions, my account of shared goals has two parts: a
      specification of their function role and a substantial description of states that
      could realise them. This section is about the functional role of shared goals,
      the following section concerns their realisation. To emphasise, questions about
      the mental states involved in sharing goals will be deferred until the next
      section; in this section the question is only what shared goals are for.</p>
      <!--l. 212-->

      <p class="indent">Successful plural activity generally requires coordination. How
      is this coordination achieved? In the case of ants such coordination may be
      achieved hormonally. In humans, who can voluntarily engage in plural activities
      with novel outcomes, coordination can usually only be achieved psychologically.
      This is what shared goals are for. Shared goals coordinate multiple agents
      goal-directed activities around an outcome to be achieved as a common effect of
      their efforts. That is, their function is to coordinate plural activities.</p>
      <!--l. 214-->

      <p class="indent">An illustration may help to clarify what performing this
      function amounts to. There is a fallen tree lying across the road. Several people
      each want it moved, but none of them can move it by themselves and none of them
      can control the others actions. The trees movement can only be secured as common
      effect of several peoples actions. In this situation, there is a need for several
      people to coordinate their goal-directed activities. They need to lift in
      complementary directions and at suitably related times; and if lifting doesnt
      work, they need to change strategy and try pushing or something else that might
      achieve the outcome. The role of shared goals is to coordinate these
      goal-directed activities.</p><!--l. 216-->

      <p class="indent">In the above illustration, plural activity is necessary to
      achieve an outcome. Shared goals also play a role in situations where plural
      activity occurs even though it is not necessary. For instance, Amin and Bertram
      each individually aim to put a large barrel into a boat. Either of them could
      move the barrel into the boat alone or their doing this could be a plural
      activity; the choice is theirs. The sequence of activities Amin would need to
      perform to put the barrel in the boat differs depending on whether he is acting
      alone or with Bertram. Acting alone, Amin would position himself so that the
      barrel and boat are in front of him, throw his arms around the middle of barrel,
      raise it, tilt back and then push up and forwards. If he chose to act with
      Bertram, Amin would need to take an entirely different approach. It is this need
      that shared goals answer.</p><!--l. 218-->

      <p class="indent">The notion that a function of shared goals is to coordinate
      goal-directed activities needs qualifying because all action involves
      coordination at several levels. Any goal-directed action, individual or joint,
      will be realised by a collection of simple object-directed actions such as
      pushing, pulling and tearing; and these in turn will be realized by some kind of
      motor actions, and so on until at some point we reach continuous bodily
      movements. Plainly most tasks require coordination at several of these levels;
      for instance, passing an object from one hand to another requires precise timing
      of releases and grasps as well as appropriate positioning in space. At some
      levels, coordination is largely independent of which goals agents actions are
      directed to (for example, it can be hard to use ones hands in an uncoordinated
      way even when doing so would be advantageous). This is true even for coordination
      of multiple agents activities. We may coordinate with others without being aware
      of how we are coordinating or even that we are coordinating (<a href=
      "#Xen_1693">Richardson et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1693">2009</a>). In
      fact there seem to be several forms of <span class="cmti-12">emergent
      coordination</span>, that is, coordination which is independent of the goals of
      an agents actions (<a href="#Xen_1812">Knoblich et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1812">2010</a>). Clearly, then, shared goals are not the only factor in
      coordinating plural activity. The role of shared goals is limited to coordinating
      goal-directed actions and not their non-purposive components, and it may be that
      shared goals can play this role only thanks to the existence of other mechanisms
      of emergent coordination.</p><!--l. 220-->

      <p class="indent">Shared goals resemble shared intentions insofar as both exist
      to coordinate activities. They differ in that structuring bargaining and
      coordinating planning are not functions of shared goals. On some views, the
      distinction I have drawn between shared intentions and shared goals parallels a
      distinction between individual intentions and more primitive states connecting
      individuals activities with the goals to which they are directed. For individual
      intentions are sometimes held to be intrinsically elements in agents plans and
      therefore absent from the lives of any agents incapable of planning (<a href=
      "#Xen_1694">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1694">2007</a>). Such agents (if there
      are any) may need to act when faced with equally desirable alternatives and to
      coordinate their activities around goals despite fluctuations in desire. This
      need might be met by states which resemble intentions in that they exist in part
      to coordinate a single agents activities and in that they connect the agents
      activities to a goal, but differ from intentions in lacking planning functions.
      Given this distinction, shared intentions would stand to shared goals roughly as
      individual intentions stand to their more primitive counterparts.</p>
      <!--l. 222-->

      <p class="indent">The limited function of shared goals makes them better suited
      than shared intentions for characterising the cases studied in developmental
      research. Many, perhaps all, of these cases would not normally require
      coordinated planning. As mentioned above, these cases include tidying up the toys
      together and cooperatively pulling handles in sequence in order to make a puppet
      sing. As coordinated planning is not needed in such cases, nor are shared
      intentions. What is needed, though, is for the agents goal-directed actions to be
      coordinated. This is what shared goals are for. <a id="x1-7003r7" name=

      <p class="noindent">In the previous section I identified shared goals in terms of
      their function, which is to coordinate plural activities. The next step is to
      characterise states capable of realising this function.</p><!--l. 229-->

      <p class="indent">To start with an illustration, suppose that a goal of Amins
      actions in the near future will be move a large barrel into a boat. Amin
      anticipates that some of Bertrams future actions will have the same goal, and
      Amin expects the barrels moving into the boat to occur as a common effect of his
      own goal-directed actions and Bertrams. For his part, moving the barrel into the
      boat will also be a goal of Bertrams actions and Bertram has expectations
      mirroring Amins. In favourable circumstances their goal-directed contributions to
      a plural activity of moving the barrel into the boat could be coordinated in
      virtue of this pattern of goal-relations and expectations. Accordingly, the
      existence of such goal-relations and expectations are sufficient for Amin and
      Bertram to share the goal of getting the barrel into the boat.</p><!--l. 231-->

      <p class="indent">Here are the key features of this case expressed in general
      terms:</p>

      <div class="quote">

        <p class="noindent">on balance each agent expects this goal to occur as a
        common effect of all of their actions directed to the goal, her own and the
        others.</p>
      </div><!--l. 253-->

      <p class="noindent">In favourable circumstances and in concert with emergent
      coordination, these goal-relations and expectations could serve to coordinate the
      goal-directed plural activities of two or more agents (I shall say which
      circumstances are favourable below). Since shared goal was defined in terms of
      this coordinating function, (a)-(d) are collectively sufficient for possessing a
      shared goal.</p><!--l. 255-->

      <p class="indent">Let us consider these four features in turn. The first feature,
      (a), is required just because we are concerned with plural activities; by
      definition, actions comprising a plural activity are directed to a single goal
      such as moving a particular barrel onto a certain boat (see Section 4). The
      second feature, (b), was not explicit in the description of Amin and Bertrams
      barrel moving. It excludes the following sort of case. Mia and Sobani are in a
      crowded space. Each intends to move a table and, thanks to her background
      knowledge, expects that exactly one other agent intends the same. But neither Mia
      nor Sobani can identify who else she expects to be involved in moving the table,
      except trivially as the other table-mover. In this case, the pattern of
      goal-relations and expectations in (a), (c) and (d) could have at most a limited
      effect on Mia and Sobanis ability to coordinate their efforts. So the
      identification requirement, (b), is included because the coordinating effect of
      (a), (c) and (d) seem to depend on it. Identification may not feature whenever
      agents have a shared goal; (a)-(d) collectively provide only sufficient
      conditions.</p><!--l. 257-->

      <p class="indent">The third and fourth features, (c) and (d), involve
      expectations. Knowledge states and beliefs both count as expectations but it is
      not necessary to have either. In developmental research, looking times and eye
      movements are regularly used as measures of infants expectations concerning goals
      (for example&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1434">Csibra et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1434">2003</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1436">Gergely &amp;
      Csibra</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1436">2003</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1207">Gergely
      et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1207">1995</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1437">Luo
      &amp; Baillargeon</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1437">2005</a>;&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1439">Woodward &amp; Sommerville</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1439">2000</a>). It
      is an open question whether these sorts of expectations are beliefs. Where such
      expectations do not merely control looking times and eye movements but also
      inform a range of goal-directed actions in ways that are rational given their
      contents, then expectations of this type are sufficient for sharing goals whether
      or not they amount to beliefs. This marks one contrast between requirements on
      sharing goals and sharing intentions. Given that intentions function to
      coordinate planning in Bratman's intellectual sense of planning and given some
      plausible norms governing the rationality of planning (<a href=
      "#Xen_1774">Hawthorne</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1774">2004</a>, pp.&nbsp;29-31),
      sharing an intention will require knowledge of others intentions and their
      relations to ones own. By contrast, sharing a goal does not require knowledge.
      because several kinds of expectation which fall short of knowledge are sufficient
      for coordinating plural activities.</p><!--l. 259-->

      <p class="indent">The third feature, (c), concerns expectations about other
      agents goal-directed actions. This is a minimal counterpart of the requirement
      that agents who share an intention represent each others intentions. Possessing a
      shared goal requires representing only goal-directed actions. It is possible to
      represent an action as goal-directed without representing (or even being able to
      represent) intentions or any other propositional attitudes. For instance, an
      agent might represent goals as functions of actions.<span class=
      "footnote-mark"><a href="#fn13x0" id="fn13x0-bk" name="fn13x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">13</sup></a></span><a id="x1-8002f13" name="x1-8002f13"></a>
      There are strong theoretical and empirical grounds to hold that representing
      goal-directed actions requires less conceptual sophistication, and may be less
      cognitively demanding, than representing intentions as such.</p><!--l. 265-->

      <p class="indent">The fourth feature, (d), concerns the agents expectations that
      the goal to which their actions are directed will occur as a common effect of
      their efforts. This and the third feature are jointly equivalent to requiring
      that the each agent expects that she and the other agents are engaged in a plural
      activity with goal G. (The agents may not actually be engaged in a single plural
      activity because, as noted earlier, plural activities are by definition
      successful whereas it is possible to possesses a shared goal without succeeding.)
      The claim that features (a)-(d) are sufficient for agents to possess a shared
      goal is the claim that this combination of features could function to coordinate
      plural activities. In essence, the claim is this: an expectation, on the part of
      each agent concerned, that she is or will be involved in a plural activity with
      the others, will, in favourable circumstances and in concert with emergent
      coordination, normally enable them to coordinate their actions.</p><!--l. 267-->

      <p class="indent">Shared intention is sometimes thought to involve common
      knowledge in such a way that agents who share an intention can know that they
      share an intention.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn14x0" id="fn14x0-bk"
      name="fn14x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">14</sup></a></span><a id=
      "x1-8003f14" name="x1-8003f14"></a> By contrast, it is possible to have a shared
      goal without knowing that one does. Agents can have, and act on (see Section 8
      below), a shared goal without understanding their actions as comprising anything
      more than a plural activity.</p><!--l. 273-->

      <p class="indent">The above pattern of goal-relations and expectations, (a)-(d),
      can play its coordinating role only in favourable circumstances. What makes
      circumstances <span class="cmti-12">un</span>favourable? One factor is a lack of
      freedom. To illustrate, suppose that Hendrik and Arch are instructed to tidy the
      toys away. Arch would not normally obey this instruction but Hendrik convincingly
      threatens reprisals unless Arch tidies all the toys away. For the goal of tidying
      the toys away, (a)-(d) above could all obtain in this case (Hendrik fulfils (a)
      by the act of threatening). But any coordinating effect this pattern of
      goal-relations and expectations might have had is trumped by Hendriks control
      over Archs actions. Archs lack of freedom is an unfavourable circumstance, that
      is, one in which the coordinating role of shared goals may be blocked. Another
      unfavourable circumstance is antagonism to plural activity. Suppose that Ella and
      Cohen have been tasked with wiping a table clean. Ella is desperate to clean the
      table without Cohen, and Cohen is desperate to clean it without Ella. Neither
      thinks this will be possible, and they satisfy (a)-(d) above. But because they
      are desperate to act alone, each tries to sabotage the others efforts. Any
      coordinating effect the shared goal might have had is overridden by the agents
      antagonism to plural activity. In short, then, favourable circumstances are those
      in which factors that would defeat the coordinating tendency of the pattern of
      goal-relations and expectations in (a)-(d) are absent; paradigm defeating factors
      are a lack of freedom and antagonism towards plural activity. <a id="x1-8004r8"

      "x1-90008"></a>Shared goals characterise one form of joint action</h3>
      <!--l. 279-->

      <p class="noindent">So far I have stipulated that the function of shared goals is
      to coordinate plural activities and argued that this function could be realised
      by a certain pattern of goal-relations and expectations. Finally I shall use this
      to characterise a form of joint action which, lacking the cognitive and
      conceptual demands associated with shared intentional action, could be used to
      explicate the premise that engaging in joint action fosters an understanding of
      minds.</p><!--l. 281-->

      <p class="indent">Shared goals are characteristic of a form of joint action but
      the relation between possession of a shared goal and performing a joint action is
      not straightforward. Compare ordinary individual action. Acting intentionally is
      not just a matter of acting and simultaneously intending; nor is it even just a
      matter of being caused to act by an intention (<a href=
      "#Xen_1211">Searle</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1211">1983</a>, pp.&nbsp;136-7).
      Relatedly, we should not suppose that the mere presence, or even the mere
      efficacy, of a shared goal is sufficient for joint action. Take any collection of
      actions directed to a single goal, G, involving two or more agents. Let us say
      that these actions, taken collectively, are <span class="cmti-12">driven by a
      shared goal</span> when G is a shared goal of the agents, when, in performing
      actions directed to this goal, they are acting on the associated expectations and
      any other attitudes in ways that are rational, and when their so acting functions
      to coordinate their actions in a way that would normally facilitate the goals
      occurring as a common effect of all their efforts. (I assume that, although the
      expectations mentioned in Section 7 may not be necessary for possessing a shared
      goal, some such expectations are always involved.) I claim that actions driven by
      shared goals are joint actions.</p><!--l. 283-->

      <p class="indent">Why accept this? Recall the six indicators of joint action
      identified earlier (Section 4). Where these three conditions hold of an
      interaction, most of these indicators will be present. The interaction will be
      distinct from a case in which the agents pursue the goal in parallel and without
      a shared goal (this was the second indicator). The action will be voluntary with
      respect to its jointness insofar as jointness is partly due to agents acting on
      their expectations in ways that are rational, as contrasted with interactions
      where coordination involves only involuntary forms of emergent coordination
      (third indicator). If the goal occurs, this will normally be in part because of
      the coordination provided by the shared goal; in this sense, the coordination
      serves to direct the agents actions, taken together, to the goal and this amounts
      to more than each agents actions being individually directed to the goal (fourth
      indicator). Finally, the agents dispositions to adapt their actions to each
      others is built into the requirement that the shared goal function to coordinate
      their actions by means of their acting on the associated expectations (sixth
      indicator). In short, actions driven by shared goals have many features
      indicative of joint action. This is reason to hold that they are in fact joint
      actions.</p><!--l. 285-->

      <p class="indent">Not every case in which actions are driven by shared goals fits
      intuitively with paradigm examples of joint action. Consider two drivers on a
      collision course in a narrow street. Suppose (perhaps unrealistically) that each
      acts with the goal of avoiding a collision between their cars, expects the other
      to do the same and expects that they will avoid collision thanks to their
      combined efforts. This is sufficient for avoiding a collision to be a shared
      goal. (Note that specifying the goal requires care: the drivers actions would
      have different goals if, for instance, the only goal of each drivers action were
      to avoid hitting the other.) Suppose also that their actions are driven by a
      shared goal in the sense defined above. So, on the above account, their avoiding
      collision is a joint action. (Not all cases of avoiding a collision are joint
      actions, only those, if any, which are driven by shared goals.) But intuitively
      this case may not seem to fit with paradigms of joint action because the
      interaction is so minor. If this counts as joint action, then, given the right
      goal-relations and expectations, so could passing someone in a corridor. Should
      we modify the account of joint action in order to exclude this sort of case?
      There is an obstacle to doing that. We could elaborate a series of interactions
      driven by the shared goal of avoiding collision where each interaction is
      slightly less minor than its predecessor in the series. Whether or not intuitions
      support drawing a boundary, it seems that no such boundary is theoretically
      significant for understanding the role of joint action in development. Since our
      aim is to characterise joint action as it fosters development, we should risk
      deviating from intuition to avoid otherwise unnecessary complexity.</p>
      <!--l. 287-->

      <p class="indent">There is another sort of case in which actions driven by a
      shared goal may not intuitively fit with paradigm joint actions. Consider again
      the two drivers whose goal is to avoid collision. Now suppose, in addition, that
      the first driver hawkishly accelerates while covertly preparing to brake if
      necessary, causing the second driver to brake hard. Given the present account,
      their actions nevertheless constitute joint action. This may not fit intuitively
      with paradigm joint actions because the first driver dominates the second (and
      does so by means of deception).<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn15x0" id=
      "fn15x0-bk" name="fn15x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">15</sup></a></span><a id="x1-9001f15" name="x1-9001f15"></a>
      Again it is possible to elaborate a series of cases involving gradually varying
      degrees of domination. While outright coercion is incompatible with joint action
      on the account I have offered (see Section 7 above), neither domination nor other
      failures to be cooperative are excluded. This may conflict with intuitions about
      joint action but reduces the complexity of the account. That the account is
      nevertheless an account of joint action is shown by the presence of the other
      indicators of joint action mentioned above.</p><!--l. 289-->

      <p class="indent">Accounts of joint action sometimes invoke special kinds of
      mental state (<a href="#Xen_1426">Gilbert</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1426">1992</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1369">Searle</a>&nbsp;<a href=

      Sugden</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1383">2007a</a>), special kinds of interdependence
      (<a href="#Xen_1356">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1356">1993</a>;&nbsp;<a href=

      kinds of agent (<a href="#Xen_2391">Helm</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_2391">2008</a>).
      The present account, if successful, shows that there is a simple kind of joint
      action characterising which requires no such special ingredients. The simple kind
      of joint action involves only ordinary individual goal directed-actions being
      coordinated in part by expectations about others goal-directed actions and their
      common effects.</p><!--l. 291-->

      <p class="indent">There are, of course, questions and puzzles about joint action
      which the simple account offered here does not address and which may call for
      greater complexity. These include issues about commitment (<a href=
      "#Xen_1287">Gilbert</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1287">2006</a>), the coordination of
      decisions to act jointly (<a href="#Xen_1297">Velleman</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1297">1997</a>), the kind of reasoning needed for coordinating choices
      (<a href="#Xen_1373">Sugden</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1373">2000</a>), and the
      possibilities of intending others actions (<a href=
      "#Xen_1369">Searle</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1369">2002</a>,&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1692">1994</a>) and of acting on others intentions (<a href=
      "#Xen_1427">Roth</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1427">2004</a>). Failure to address these
      questions or tackle these puzzles might be an objection if the simple account
      were meant to be the whole story about joint action. In fact the simple account
      is not supposed to apply to every case of joint action. For instance, painting a
      house together will probably involve intentionally coordinating plans and so
      require sharing intentions rather than merely sharing goals. On the other hand,
      in some cases joint action does not require planning, commitment, coordinating
      decisions to act or special kinds of reasoning. Knoblich and Sebanz offer an
      example:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 294-->

        <p class="noindent">the way people lift a two-handled basket depends on whether
        they lift it alone or together. When alone, a person would normally grasp each
        handle with one hand. When together, one person would normally grasp the left
        handle with his/her right hand and the other person would grasp the right
        handle with his/her left hand. (<a href="#Xen_1429">Knoblich &amp;

      </div><!--l. 297-->

      <p class="noindent">Because handles provide an obvious way for two people to lift
      the basket (these authors even postulate a joint affordance) and people are often
      skilled at coordinated lifting, planning is typically unnecessary and it is
      plausible that shared goals are sufficient for joint actions of this
      sort.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn16x0" id="fn16x0-bk" name=

      <p class="noindent">The question was this. Given the premise that joint action
      plays some role in explaining how children come to understand minds, what could
      joint action be? The negative point was that it couldnt involve sharing
      intentions for reasons connected to the fact that sharing intentions involves
      coordinating planning and so requires sophistication in ascribing propositional
      attitudes. The positive claim was that there is a simple account of joint action
      which is compatible with the developmental premise. On the simple account, joint
      action involves sharing goals and sharing goals requires only an understanding of
      goal-directed actions and their common effects.</p><!--l. 305-->

      <p class="indent">This simple account of joint action is not offered as a
      replacement for Bratman's account or any accounts competing with his. Bratman's
      account assumes that joint action involves shared intention where the functions
      of shared intention include coordinating paradigmatically long-term plans. Such
      an account may be required to characterise complex cases where success demands
      that agents plans mesh. But some cases of joint action (such as carrying a
      two-handled basket together) do not involve plans in the relevant sense of
      planning. The agents need to coordinate their activities but not their plans. The
      simple account applies only in such cases. In philosophical accounts of
      individual action, actions explainable by intending are sometimes distinguished
      from other kinds of individual action including response behaviours, arrational
      actions and merely purposive activities (<a href="#Xen_181">Dickinson &amp;
      Balleine</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_181">1993</a>;&nbsp;<a href=

      "#Xen_25">Velleman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_25">2000</a>). Comparable distinctions
      are certain to be needed for understanding joint action; the differences between
      shared intentions and shared goals mark one such distinction between kinds of
      joint action.</p>

Title: Joint Action: What Is Shared?  Introduction to the special issue
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill and Natalie Sebanz
Year: 2011
Journal: Review of Philosophy and Psychology
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Joint action raises a tangle of philosophical, developmental and cognitive questions. Many of these questions are naturally understood to be about sharing, about the sharing of intentions, emotions, task representations, and action plans. Of course it is not easy to explain what it means to share in this context. Few researchers hold that agents can literally share intentions, emotions or other states in the sense in which two siblings share a parent; and while it is uncontroversial that agents can share intentions, emotions and other states in the sense in which siblings share genes, on almost any account this kind of sharing is not sufficient for joint action. The overarching question in this special issue is which forms of sharing (if any) are needed to explain the development of joint action, to characterise the mechanisms which make effective joint action possible and to explain what joint action is. In this Introduction we will explain how the papers in this special issue contribute to answering this question and, in some cases, raise new puzzles.

Title: Direct and indirect measures of Level-2 perspective-taking in children and adults
Authors: Andrew Surtees, Stephen A. Butterfill and Ian Apperly
Year: 2012
Journal: British Journal of Developmental Psychology
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Studies with infants show divergence between performance on theory of mind tasks depending on whether direct or indirect measures are used. It has been suggested that direct measures assess a flexible but cognitively demanding ability to reason about the minds of others, whereas indirect measures assess distinct processes which afford more efficient but less flexible theory of mind abilities (Apperly & Butterfill, 2009). This leads to the prediction that performance on indirect measures should be subject to signature limits. The current study tested whether the Level-1/Level-2 distinction might constitute one such limit. The study adapted a task that has shown evidence of Level-1 perspective-taking on both direct and indirect measures (Samson, Apperly, Braithwaite, Andrews, & Bodley-Scott, 2010). The aim was to test Level-2 perspective-taking in a sample of 6- to 11-year-olds (N = 80) and adults (N = 20). Participants were able to make Level-2 judgements on the direct measure. In contrast with the findings from Level-1 perspective-taking, there was no evidence of automatic processing of Level-2 perspectives on the indirect measure. This finding is consistent with the view that theory of mind abilities assessed by indirect measures are subject to signature limits. The Level-1/Level-2 distinction, suitably refined, marks one way in which efficient but inflexible theory of mind abilities are limited.

Title: Joint Action Goals Reduce Visuomotor Interference Effects from a Partner’s Incongruent Actions
Authors: Sam Clarke, Luke McEllin, Anna Francová, Marcell Székely, Stephen A. Butterfill and John Michael
Year: 2019
Journal: Scientific Reports
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Joint actions often require agents to track others’ actions while planning and executing physically incongruent actions of their own. Previous research has indicated that this can lead to visuomotor interference effects when it occurs outside of joint action. How is this avoided or overcome in joint actions? We hypothesized that when joint action partners represent their actions as interrelated components of a plan to bring about a joint action goal, each partner’s movements need not be represented in relation to distinct, incongruent proximal goals. Instead they can be represented in relation to a single proximal goal – especially if the movements are, or appear to be, mechanically linked to a more distal joint action goal. To test this, we implemented a paradigm in which participants produced finger movements that were either congruent or incongruent with those of a virtual partner, and either with or without a joint action goal (the joint flipping of a switch, which turned on two light bulbs). Our findings provide partial support for the hypothesis that visuomotor interference effects can be reduced when two physically incongruent actions are represented as mechanically interdependent contributions to a joint action goal.

Title: Mindreading in the Balance: Adults’ Mediolateral Leaning and Anticipatory Looking Foretell Others’ Action Preparation in a False-Belief Interactive Task
Authors: Giovanni Zani, Stephen A. Butterfill and Jason Low
Year: 2020
Journal: Royal Society Open Science
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Anticipatory looking on mindreading tasks can indicate our expectation of an agent's action. The challenge is that social situations are often more complex, involving instances where we need to track an agent's false belief to successfully identify the outcome to which an action is directed. If motor processes can guide how action goals are understood, it is conceivable—where that kind of goal ascription occurs in false-belief tasks—for motor representations to account for someone's belief-like state. Testing adults (N = 42) in a real-time interactive helping scenario, we discovered that participants' early mediolateral motor activity (leftwards–rightwards leaning on balance board) foreshadowed the agent's belief-based action preparation. These results suggest fast belief-tracking can modulate motor representations generated in the course of one's interaction with an agent. While adults' leaning, and anticipatory looking, revealed the contribution of fast false-belief tracking, participants did not correct the agent's mistake in their final helping action. These discoveries suggest that adults may not necessarily use another's belief during overt social interaction or find reflecting on another's belief as being normatively relevant to one's own choice of action. Our interactive task design offers a promising way to investigate how motor and mindreading processes may be variously integrated.

Title: How to Construct a Minimal Theory of Mind

Journal: Mind and Language
Type: Publication

## Abstract

What could someone represent that would enable her to track, at least within limits, others' perceptions, knowledge states and beliefs including false beliefs?  An obvious possibility is that she might represent these very attitudes as such. It is sometimes tacitly or explicitly assumed that this is the only possible answer. However we argue that several recent discoveries in developmental, cognitive, and comparative psychology indicate the need for other, less obvious possibilities. Our aim is to meet this need by describing the construction of a minimal theory of mind.  Minimal theory of mind is rich enough to explain systematic success on tasks held to be acid tests for theory of mind cognition including many false belief tasks. Yet minimal theory of mind does not require representing propositional attitudes, or any other kind of representation, as such. Minimal theory of mind may be what enables those with limited cognitive resources or little conceptual sophistication, such as infants, chimpanzees, scrub-jays and human adults under load,  to track others' perceptions, knowledge states and beliefs.

Title: What are Modules and What Is Their Role in Development?
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2007
Journal: Mind and Language
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Modules are widely held to play a central role in explaining mental development and in accounts of the mind generally. But there is much disagreement about what modules are, which shows that we do not adequately understand modularity. This paper outlines a Fodoresque approach to understanding one type of modularity. It suggests that we can distinguish modular from nonmodular cognition by reference to the kinds of process involved, and that modular cognition differs from nonmodular forms of cognition in being a special kind of computational process. The paper concludes by considering implications for the role of modules in explaining mental development.

Title: Motor Representation in Acting Together
Authors: Corrado Sinigaglia and Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2022
Journal: Synthese
Type: Publication

## Abstract

People walk, build, paint and otherwise act together with a purpose in myriad ways. What is the relation between the actions people perform in acting together with a purpose and the outcome, or outcomes, to which their actions are directed? We argue that fully characterising this relation will require appeal not only to intention, knowledge and other familiar philosophical paraphernalia but also to another kind of representation involved in preparing and executing actions, namely motor representation. If we are right, motor representation plays a central role in the story of acting together.

Title: Motor Representation and Action Experience in Joint Action
Authors: Corrado Sinigaglia and Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2020
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Acting together with a purpose is a familiar feature of everyday life. We jump together, play music together and move tables together. But what do we experience of action in acting together? It is perhaps tempting to suppose that there is a special way in which we can experience our own actions, and that we cannot experience the actions of others in this way. This view would imply that in acting together, our own actions are experienced in a way that our partners’ actions are not. However recent research on motor representation suggests that, in observing another act, it may be possible to experience her actions in whatever sense we can experience our own actions. This makes it at least conceivable that in acting together we can experience the actions each of us performs in the same way. But the occurrence of a joint action involves more than merely the occurrences of two individual actions. Are there experiences of joint actions which involve more than merely two or more experiences of individual actions? In this chapter we defend a positive answer. In some cases, experiences associated with joint action are experiences of action in whatever sense experiences of acting alone are.

Title: Motor Representation in Goal Ascription
Authors: Corrado Sinigaglia and Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2016
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Goal ascription, the process of identifying outcomes to which purposive actions are directed, is indispensable for predicting others’ behaviours and understanding their minds.  
But which mechanisms underpin goal ascription?
This chapter examines several ways in which motor representations and processes are involved in different forms of goal ascription.
We argue that motor representations and processes matter for goal ascription in two ways.
They provide for capturing the directedness of an action to an outcome, and they shape the observers’ experiences of actions in such a way that these experiences reveal the goals of actions.
The occurrence of motor representations in action observation thereby makes available, independently of any prior knowledge of others’ mental states, a route to knowledge of the goals of their actions.

Title: Motor Representation and Knowledge of Skilled Action
Authors: Corrado Sinigaglia and Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2020
Type: Publication

## Abstract

If you are more skilled in performing certain actions, you are probably also better able to acquire knowledge when observing those actions. Why are performance skills so connected to observation skills? In this chapter, the authors defend a conjecture: it is because performing and observing actions involves a common element, namely motor representations of outcomes to which the actions are directed. This conjecture, which is supported by a significant body of evidence, implies that motor representations can have content-respecting influences on knowledge states. How is this possible? How do motor representations interface with knowledge states? Several distinct candidate answers have been proposed, but the evidence that would distinguish them is not yet available. There is, then, a major gap in our understanding of how expertise matters for gaining knowledge of observed actions. We know that motor representations do, in fact, facilitate the acquisition of observational knowledge, but no one can yet say how they do so.

Title: Visibly constraining an agent modulates observers’ automatic false-belief tracking
Authors: Jason Low, Katheryn Edwards & Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2020
Journal: Scientific Reports
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Our motor system can generate representations which carry information about the goals of another agent’s actions. However, it is not known whether motor representations play a deeper role in social understanding, and, in particular, whether they enable tracking others’ beliefs. Here we show that, for adult observers, reliably manifesting an ability to track another’s false belief critically depends on representing the agent’s potential actions motorically. One signature of motor representations is that they can be disrupted by constraints on an observed agent’s action capacities. We therefore used a ‘mummification’ technique to manipulate whether the agent in a visual ball-detection task was free to act or whether he was visibly constrained from acting. Adults’ reaction times reliably reflected the agent’s beliefs only when the agent was free to act on the ball and not when the agent was visibly constrained from acting. Furthermore, it was the agent’s constrained action capabilities, rather than any perceptual novelty, that determined whether adult observers’ reaction times reliably reflected the agent’s beliefs. These findings signal that our motor system may underpin more of social cognition than previously imagined, and, in particular, that motor representations may underpin automatic false-belief tracking.

Title: Perceiving Expressions of Emotion: What evidence could bear on questions about perceptual experience of mental states?
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2015
Journal: Consciousness and Cognition
Type: Publication

## Abstract

What evidence could bear on questions about whether humans ever perceptually experience any of another’s mental states, and how might those questions be made precise enough to test experimentally? This paper focusses on emotions and their expression. It is proposed that research on perceptual experiences of physical properties provides one model for thinking about what evidence concerning expressions of emotion might reveal about perceptual experiences of others’ mental states. This proposal motivates consideration of the hypothesis that categorical perception of expressions of emotion occurs, can be facilitated by information about agents’ emotions, and gives rise to phenomenal expectations. It is argued that the truth of this hypothesis would support a modest version of the claim that humans sometimes perceptually experience some of another’s mental states. Much available evidence is consistent with, but insufficient to establish, the truth of the hypothesis. We are probably not yet in a position to know whether humans ever perceptually experience others’ mental states.

Title: Planning for Collective Agency
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2016
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Which planning mechanisms enable agents to coordinate their actions, and what if anything do these tell us about the nature of collective agency?  On the leading, best developed account, Michael Bratman's, collective agency  is explained in terms of interconnected planning.  For our plans to be interconnected is for them to concern not just facts about our environment and goals but also facts about each others' plans.  This chapter contrasts interconnected with parallel planning.  In parallel planning, we each individually plan all of our actions and so are in a position to conceive of our own and each other's actions as parts of a single plan or exercises of a single ability.  (The very idea of parallel planning may initially seem incoherent; the chapter examines this issue.)  Could parallel rather than interconnected planning underpin intentional collective agency?  Some considerations in favour of a positive answer are provided by appeal to recent evidence on the role of motor representation in coordinating exercises of collective agency.

Title: From foraging to autonoetic consciousness: The primal self as a consequence of embodied prospective foraging
Authors: Thomas T. Hills and Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2015
Journal: Current Zoology
Type: Publication

## Abstract

The capacity to adapt to resource distributions by modulating the frequency of exploratory and exploitative behaviors is common across metazoans and is arguably a principal selective force in the evolution of cognition. Here we (1) review recent work investigating behavioral and biological commonalities between external foraging in space and internal foraging over environments specified by cognitive representations, and (2) explore the implications of these commonalities for understanding the origins of the self. Behavioural commonalities include the capacity for what is known as area-restricted search in the ecological literature: this is search focussed around locations where resources have been found in the past, but moving away from locations where few resources are found, and capable of producing movement patterns mimicking Lévy flights. Area-restricted search shares a neural basis across metazoans, and these biological commonalities in vertebrates suggest an evolutionary homology between external and internal foraging. Internal foraging, and in particular a form we call embodied prospective foraging, makes available additional capacities for prediction based on search through a cognitive representation of the external environment, and allows predictions about outcomes of possible future actions. We demonstrate that cognitive systems that use embodied prospective foraging require a primitive sense of self, needed to distinguish actual from simulated action. This relationship has implications for understanding the evolution of autonoetic consciousness and self-awareness.

Title: Psychological Research on Joint Action: Theory and Data
Authors: Guenther Knoblich, Stephen A. Butterfill and Natalie Sebanz
Year: 2011
Type: Publication

## Abstract

When two or more people coordinate their actions in space and time to produce a joint outcome, they perform a joint action. The perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes that enable individuals to coordinate their actions with others have been receiving increasing attention during the last decade, complement- ing earlier work on shared intentionality and discourse. This chapter reviews current theoretical concepts and empirical findings in order to provide a structured overview of the state of the art in joint action research. We distin- guish between planned and emergent coordination. In planned coordination, agents' behavior is driven by representations that specify the desired outcomes of joint action and the agent's own part in achieving these outcomes. In emergent coordination, coordinated behavior occurs due to perception-action couplings that make multiple individuals act in similar ways, independently of joint plans. We review evidence for the two types of coordination and discuss potential synergies between them.

Title: On a Puzzle about Relations between Thought, Experience and the Motoric
Authors: Corrado Sinigaglia and Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2015
Journal: Synthese
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Motor representations live a kind of double life. Although paradigmatically involved in performing actions, they also occur when merely observing others act and sometimes influence thoughts about the goals of observed actions. Further, these influences are content-respecting: what you think about an action sometimes depends in part on how that action is represented motorically in you.  The existence of such content-respecting influences is puzzling. After all, motor representations do not feature alongside beliefs or intentions  in reasoning about action; indeed, thoughts are inferentially isolated from motor representations. So how could motor representations have content-respecting influences on thoughts? Our aim is to solve this puzzle.  In so doing, we shall provide the basis for an account of how experience links the motoric with thought. Such an account matters for understanding how humans think about action: in some cases, we have reasons for thoughts about actions that we would not have if we were unable to represent those actions motorically.

Title: Review of Self-Knowing Agents by Lucy O'Brien
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2009
Journal: Philosophical Review
Type: Publication

<p>The first-person is "expressive of self-consciousness" (64).  Someone who uses the first-person, for example in saying or thinking "Where am I?",  not only succeeds in referring to herself but also knows that she refers to herself.  In Self-Knowing Agents, O'Brien's primary aim is to explain how it is that using the first-person guarantees this knowledge-that is, to explain "how it is that 'I' expresses self-consciousness" (57).</p>
<p>The explanation hinges on agent's awareness, the awareness an agent has of an action by virtue of controlling it.  Control consists in this: the agent evaluates possibilities for action which she is aware of as possibilities; then she selects, endorses or accepts one (116-7, 183).  The possibilities in question are basic actions, that is, actions the subject can carry out without having to do anything else (163-5).  The process of evaluation and selection immediately determines how the agent will act.  For this reason, an agent who knows that some action resulted from her evaluation and selection is in a position to know which basic action resulted (165).  Further, nobody else's actions can be immediately determined by her process of evaluation and selection, only the agent's (184).  For this reason, if an agent knows that some action occurred as an immediate consequence of her process of evaluation and selection, then she is able to know that the action is her action (119).  The general idea, then, is that agent's awareness does not involve first-person reference but does enable agents to know with respect to their own actions both who is acting and what the action is (123).</p>
<p>The explanation of how 'I' expresses self-consciousness is now straightforward.  O'Brien holds that there are mental actions and that judging, wondering and supposing are all actions (89).  Using the first-person in thought or talk is a basic action (or perhaps a component of one) and so can be done with agent's awareness.  Where the first-person is used with agent's awareness, the agent can know that her action is one of using the first-person and that she is the agent of this action.  Now users of the first-person also know that the first-person is governed by the rule that it refers to the subject who produced it (77).  Knowledge of this rule in combination with agent's awareness enables subjects who use the first-person to judge that they have referred to themselves.  </p>
<p>In short, given some general knowledge about the term 'I', what enables us to know who we are referring to when using 'I' is the act of using 'I' itself.  </p>
<p>The book also explores a set of related claims about self-knowledge.  These centre on the question, How do we know which bodily action we are performing and, in the case of mental action, which thought we are thinking?  As sketched above, agent's awareness provides an answer.  When an action results from evaluating and selecting possibilities that we are aware of as possibilities, the agent can know what she is thinking or doing because she selected it.  So it is the fact of acting with agent's awareness and not any perception or representation of our actions that enables us to know what we are thinking and doing.</p>
<p>The positive claims of Self-Knowing Agents are supported by critical discussion of alternative positions.  One type of alternative is to reject the datum O'Brien sets out to explain, that the first-person is expressive of self-consciousness.  This might be rejected either on the grounds that 'I' does not refer (Anscombe) or the grounds that using the first-person need not involve knowing that one refers to oneself (Mellor).   Both views are countered in detail (Chapter 2 and 59-65).  Perceptual accounts are another type of alternative to O'Brien's position.  In Chapter 3, O'Brien discusses the view that self-conscious self-reference might be grounded in bodily awareness and Gareth Evans' view that self-conscious self-reference depends on being able to use perceptual information to track one's own location.  Both views imply that perception, or at least memory based on perception, is necessary for self-conscious self-reference (47-8).  O'Brien objects that we could use the first-person self-consciously while suffering complete memory loss and full sensory deprivation (4-5, 34, 46).</p>
<p>Is it true, as O'Brien and others claim, that agents would know who their own uses of 'I' referred to even if deprived of memory and perception?  Although this claim carries much weight in Self-Knowing Agents, it is not defended.  Unless this claim is obviously true, there is a gap in the main argument against perceptual accounts.</p>
<p>O'Brien interprets others' views in the most charitable way possible and faces objections to her own squarely.  She also identifies a counterexample to her own position.  Recall that agent's awareness was characterised in terms of control over action.  This control takes the form of evaluating possibilities for action and selecting one.  When the action is judging, O'Brien illustrates the general idea by suggesting that we "accept or endorse a given thought in the light of our awareness of the possible judgements we could make, and the reasons in favour of one over another" (116).  But consider being suddenly struck by the thought, "I am supposed to be outside the school gates right now" (90).  Thinking this thought seems to involve self-reference as expressive of self-consciousness as any other use of the first-person.  But being struck by a thought involves no process of evaluating possible thoughts and so does not involve agent's awareness.  On the face of it, then, O'Brien's account cannot explain self-conscious uses of the first-person in all cases.</p>
<p>The problem also affects O'Brien's account of self-knowledge.  Many of our actions, including our judgements, are triggered by things others say or do, and by changes in our situation.  The rude remark provokes a swift retort, the infant's smile induces a hug.  Agents don't generally evaluate and select possibilities in such cases, but they do exercise control to the extent that they can inhibit their actions.  Control by inhibition cannot explain self-knowledge; indeed, inhibition sometimes requires awareness of which action one is inhibiting.  So agent's awareness construed as evaluation and selection cannot explain an agent's knowledge of which action she is performing in these cases.</p>
<p>O'Brien's main response to these counterexamples is to suggest that they are derivative in the sense that self-knowledge in cases lacking agent's awareness depends on the existence of other cases in which there is agent's awareness (90-2).  This suggestion is hard to evaluate without an account of how the dependence works.  When an infant's smile induces hugging (say), how does the agent's knowledge of who is acting now depend on her knowledge of who acted on other occasions?  O'Brien's core idea is that the fact of acting enables an agent to know who is acting.  This seems equally plausible in cases where action is not the outcome of a process evaluation and selection.  Perhaps, then, the substantive account of agent's awareness needs modification.  As it stands, O'Brien's account makes no appeal to connections among a subject's thoughts and actions.  The account works as well for an agent who acts just once as it does for an agent who enjoys a long and eventful life.  If the lives of self-consciousness agents necessarily form more than a series of isolated actions, one way to modify the account of agent's awareness would be to appeal to how an agent's judgements fit with her other thoughts and how her bodily actions affect her plans.  </p>
<p>Self-Knowing Agents is a deep and ambitious book which develops and defends a new thesis about the role of agency in self-reference and self-knowledge.  Readers will be grateful that O'Brien sets the scene for her account with sympathetic and rigorous discussion of competing and connected positions.  And there is a richness to the book which this review entirely fails capture, for O'Brien deftly weaves the main arguments into larger-scale views about the nature of action, bodily awareness and agency.</p>

Title: Review of The Rational Imagination by Ruth Byrne
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2008
Journal: Mind
Type: Publication

## Abstract

This book develops a mental models approach to counterfactual thinking. It brings together a large body of empirical research by the author and collaborators, and interprets the findings in the light of some novel views about meaning.  In this review, I argue that unless indicative conditional, counterfactual, and causal assertions really do all mean the same thing, the mental models discussed in <i>The Rational Imagination</i>  are not adequate for explaining counterfactual and causal reasoning.

Title: Review of Thinking without Words by Jose Luis Bermudez
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2004
Journal: Mind
Type: Publication

<p>That some animals, early hominids and infants think (or did so once) is increasingly hard to doubt.  Our evidence includes everything from the manufacture and use of tools (55, 127), to the ways infants react when shown apparently impossible physical events (81).  Berm&uacute;dez' project is to explain the nature of this thinking.  How can we know what an infant, ape or early hominid thinks?  What determines the contents of their thoughts?  Are they thinkers in just the sense that you and I are, or do we humans become fundamentally different types of thinker with our own distinctive cognitive abilities after infancy?  Thinking without Words offers answers to these questions, mixing philosophical argument with accounts of empirical research.</p>
<p>The notion that there is such a thing as 'thinking without words' is doubly controversial.  First, some philosophers hold that creatures incapable of communication by language are also  incapable of thought.  Berm&uacute;dez counters this view in Chapter 3, where he argues at length that some non- and pre-linguistic creatures are capable of real thinking-that is, their decision-making involves both structured representations and instrumental reasoning about the consequences of actions (51).  Second, the notion of 'thinking without words' is controversial because, assuming that nonlinguistic creatures can think, it is not obvious that their thinking differs in kind from ours.  And even supposing their thinking does differ in kind from ours, it is not obvious that this has anything to do with language.  However, as I will shortly explain, Berm&uacute;dez argues that languageless creatures' thinking is more limited than ours and that 'an important class of thoughts ... is in principle unavailable to nonlinguistic creatures' (150).  Not only does their thinking exclude inference (111) and practical reasoning (131-2); they are also unable to think thoughts involving logical constants such as NOT and quantifiers such as EVERY (Chapters 8-9).  If Berm&uacute;dez is right that languageless creatures don't infer or quantify, what could their thinking be like?  Come to think of it, how could they be thinking at all?</p>
<p>Berm&uacute;dez adopts a nice strategy for answering these questions.  Take a theory about some aspect of thinking, a theory which is coherent but doesn't quite work because it lacks the resources to capture our ordinary ways of thinking.  Then see whether that theory might work for a creature whose thinking is more limited than ours.  Recycling theories in this way makes a virtue of their limitations, provided the theories are limited in just the ways that the target creatures' thinking is limited.  Take NOT, a concept which apes are supposed to lack on account of their languageless state (as I'll soon explain).  Some philosophers have held that NOT modifies predicates rather than whole sentences.  While that probably isn't how our concept NOT works, there could be an element of ape thinking-'protonegation'-that does work this way (142-5).  So it is that Berm&uacute;dez attempts to characterise nonlinguistic thinking by recycling a failed theory of negation.  The same strategy is used to explain what determines the contents of nonlinguistic creatures' thoughts.  Take 'success semantics', a theory according to which 'the content of a belief is given by ... the condition that would have to obtain for the various desires associated with it to be satisfied' (65).  While success semantics probably isn't right for our thoughts (66-8), Berm&uacute;dez suggests, it's the sort of theory we need for nonlinguistic thought.</p>
<p>Why is nonlinguistic thinking supposed to be limited?  In Chapters 8 and 9, Berm&uacute;dez argues like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Thinking thoughts containing NOT requires the ability to think 'about how the truth-value of one thought might be related to the truth-value of another thought' (178); this is 'intentional ascent'.</li>
  <li>Intentional ascent requires 'semantic ascent', which is the ability to think about sentences.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ol start="3">
  <li>Using NOT requires the ability to communicate by language.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to NOT, this argument is supposed to work for any truth-functional connective, quantifier, tense operator or modal operator.</p>
<p>The first premise, [1], is merely stated.  Although quite widely held, it is not obvious how this premise could be true.  Is Berm&uacute;dez' position that the ability to think about the truth values of thoughts is always, or even just sometimes, actually exercised in thinking thoughts containing NOT?  If it is, then we need to know how this ability is exercised.  As he notes, thinking THE CAT IS NOT HERE doesn't involve thinking about the truth values of thoughts in anything like the sense in which it involves thinking about cats (178).  If, on the other hand, Berm&uacute;dez' position is that thinking thoughts containing NOT never involves exercising an ability to think about the truth values of thoughts, then he needs to explain how merely having this ability could be a necessary condition for thinking thoughts containing NOT.  Either way, it is unclear how, if at all, an ability to think about the truth values of thoughts is involved in thinking NOT-thoughts.</p>
<p>The second premise, [2], is argued for.  First, assume Dummett's view that thinking about thoughts requires thinking about their vehicles.  Then, since intentional ascent involves 'conscious cognitive access to the target thoughts', it follows that the vehicles of these thoughts must be accessible to consciousness (159).  Finally, Berm&uacute;dez argues that 'public language sentences are the only possible ... vehicles for thoughts that are to be the objects of reflexive thinking', and he does this by eliminating rival candidates (160).  One problem with this argument is that since, as Berm&uacute;dez says, 'we have little idea of what the vehicle of nonlinguistic thought might be' (192), he can hardly have eliminated this particular vehicle or have shown that a thought's having this vehicle would not permit it to be an object of reflexive thinking.  Another problem with arguing by elimination is that it sheds no light on why the conclusion is true.  If we really can think about a thought only when we have somehow expressed it in a sentence that we use to communicate with, I'd like to know why.  An argument from elimination leaves it mysterious why there should be a link between sentences we use for communication and thoughts we can think about.  In short, then, much more needs to be said to explicate and defend the two premises of Berm&uacute;dez' main argument relating thought and language.</p>
<p>The project of understanding early hominid, infant and animal thought is surely interesting and important, but I don't yet see what their lack of language has to do with it.  A second way of relating thought and language is implicit in Thinking without Words.  Berm&uacute;dez remarks that '[w]e have no theoretical framework for understanding the content and nature of nonlinguistic thought' (vii).  Does this mean that we do have a theoretical framework for understanding language-users' thoughts?  In Chapter 2, Berm&uacute;dez gives the impression that we do, and that Gotlob Frege and Michael Dummett have together succeeded in providing it.  The key to their theory is the claim that to grasp a thought is to understand a sentence which expresses it.  This theory doesn't work for the languageless, Berm&uacute;dez claims, because 'no account has yet been given of what it might be to grasp a thought independently of understanding a sentence' (19).  I read Berm&uacute;dez as implying that thinking without words is especially problematic because we have an adequate conception of thinking which applies only to language-users.  But do we?  Let's concede that grasping a thought is understanding a sentence which expresses it.  Now we need to know what constitutes understanding a sentence.  And of course no one has got very far with explaining this-or, at least, no one has got further with this than they have with explaining what it is to grasp a thought.  Why not?  Probably because understanding a sentence involves grasping the thought it expresses.  An animal's having a language would make it easier to understand the nature of its thinking only if we knew what it is to understand a sentence; but the problem of understanding sentences turns out to be no easier than the problem of grasping thoughts.  In this respect, language-using animals' thinking is no better understood than languageless animals'.  </p>
<p>The arguments relating thought and language are quite a small part of this book.  The main part, Chapters 3-7, is a systematic attempt to describe a kind of thought and an associated kind of thinking, and to relate this theoretical description to a wide variety of experimental research.  Even if Berm&uacute;dez hasn't fully explained what this kind of thinking has to do with language, the more important question is surely whether he's right about how any of his subjects-animals, infants and early hominids-think.  On this point the book offers many valuable insights.  I'm about to recommend it to you as a tremendous resource which takes in an enormous range of experimental work and is full of ideas about the nature of thought.  But first I want to raise another objection.</p>
<p>Berm&uacute;dez describes his book as a first step towards providing 'a conceptual foundation for the various disciplines that are committed to giving psychological explanations of the behavior of nonlinguistic creatures' (193).  Talk of foundations is misleading because Berm&uacute;dez' position is in part an error theory.  You wouldn't know it from reading this book, but an important cluster of theories in developmental psychology are deeply committed to the hypothesis that infants think and reason in just the ways that adults do.  Take Ren&eacute;e Baillargeon's research on infants' understanding of how objects behave.  The presentation of her research in Thinking without Words is selective; Berm&uacute;dez says only that Baillargeon has shown that infants are 'sensitive' to certain higher-order principles about the ways objects behave (54, 78).  But Baillargeon, like other researchers, is not content to describe infant cognition using uninformative notions like 'sensitivity'.  She aims for a deeper understanding of what happens when infants perceive objects.  Her experiments are designed to show that 'infants, like older learners, formulate rules or hypotheses about physical events and revise and elaborate these hypotheses in light of additional input' (Aguiar and Baillargeon, 'Developments in Young Infants' Reasoning About Occluded Objects', Cognitive Psychology, 2002, 45:267-336, p. 329).  According to Berm&uacute;dez, however, infants are incapable of testing or revising hypotheses; at best they are capable of 'protoinference', which is not how older learners reason.  So, far from constituting a foundation for Baillargeon's psychological explanations, Berm&uacute;dez' views are incompatible with them.  </p>
<p>Berm&uacute;dez engages with scientists' views about thought in other work (for example, in The Paradox of Self-Consciousness, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998, pp. 62-76); a deeper level of engagement would also have benefited this book.  Take infants' perceptions of objects again.  Whether and how infants think about objects is currently much debated within psychology.  There are several versions of the view that infants discover the properties of objects by formulating and testing hypotheses; there are also psychologists who deny that infants think about (as opposed to perceive) objects at all; and there are those who, like Berm&uacute;dez, hold that infants do think about objects but not in the same way that older people do.  The fact that his view conflicts with other researchers' views is part of what makes it worth studying.  </p>
<p>Thinking without Words is an accessible and fascinating book; it develops a theory of how animals, early hominids and infants think, which is supported by reference to many different areas of research as well as by philosophical arguments.  Anyone who cares about any kind of thinking should enjoy reading it.</p>

Title: Seeing Causes and Hearing Gestures
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2009
Journal: Philosophical Quarterly
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Can humans see causal interactions? Evidence on the visual perception of causal interactions, from Michotte to contemporary work, is best interpreted as showing that we can see some causal interactions in the same sense as that in which we can hear speech. Causal perception, like speech perception, is a form of categorical perception.

Title: Seeing It Both Ways: Using a Double-Cuing Task to Investigate the Role of Spatial Cuing in Level-1 Visual Perspective-Taking
Authors: John Michael, Thomas Wolf, Clément Letesson, Stephen A. Butterfill, Joshua Skewes Jakob Hohwy
Year: 2018
Journal: Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Previous research using the dot-perspective task has produced evidence that humans may be equipped with a mechanism that spontaneously tracks others’ gaze direction and thereby acquires information about what they can see. Other findings, however, support the alternative hypothesis that a spatial-cuing mechanism underpins the effect observed in the dot-perspective task. To adjudicate between these hypotheses, we developed a double-cuing version of Posner’s (1980) spatial-cuing paradigm to be implemented in the dot-perspective task, and conducted 3 experiments in which we manipulated stimulus-onset asynchrony, as well as secondary task demands. Crucially, the 2 conflicting hypotheses generated divergent patterns of predictions across these experimental conditions. Our results support the hypothesis of an automatic perspective-taking mechanism.

Title: Taking Apart What Brings Us Together: The Role of Action Prediction, Perspective-Taking, and Theory of Mind in Joint Action

Year: 2022
Journal: Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology
Type: Publication

## Abstract

The ability to act together with others to achieve common goals is crucial in life, yet there is no full consensus on the underlying cognitive skills. While influential theoretical accounts suggest that interaction requires sophisticated insights into others’ minds, alternative views propose that high-level social skills might not be necessary because interactions are grounded on sensorimotor predictive mechanisms. At present, empirical evidence is insufficient to decide between the two. This study addressed this issue and explored the association between performance at joint action tasks and cognitive abilities in three domains—action prediction, perspective-taking, and theory of mind—in healthy adults (N = 58). We found that, while perspective-taking played a role in reading the behaviour of others independently of the social context, action prediction abilities specifically influenced the agents’ performance in an interactive task but not in a control (social but non-interactive) task. In our study, performance at a theory of mind test did not play any role, as confirmed by Bayesian analyses. The results suggest that, in adults, sensorimotor predictive mechanisms might play a significant and specific role in supporting interpersonal coordination during motor interactions. We discuss the implications of our findings for the contrasting theoretical views described earlier and propose a way they might be partly reconciled.

Title: Tracking and Representing Others’ Mental States
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2017
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Few things matter more than the mental states of those nearby. Their ignorance defines
limits on cooperation and presents opportunities to exploit in competition. (If she’s seen
where you stashed those mealworms she’ll pilfer them when you’re gone, leaving you without
breakfast. And you won’t get that grape if he hears you sneaking past.) What others feel,
see and know can also provide information about events otherwise beyond your ken. It’s no
surprise, then, that abilities to track others’ mental states are widespread. Many animals
including scrub jays (Clayton, Dally and Emery 2007), ravens (Bugnyar, Reber and Buckner
2016), goats (Kaminski, Call and Tomasello 2006), dogs (Kaminski et al. 2009), ringtailed
lemurs (Sandel, MacLean and Hare 2011), monkeys (Burkart and Heschl 2007; Hattori,
Kuroshima and Fujita 2009) and chimpanzees (Melis, Call and Tomasello 2006; Karg et al.
2015) reliably vary their actions in ways that are appropriate given facts about another’s
mental states. What underpins such abilities to track others’ mental states?

Title: Two Kinds of Purposive Action
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2001
Journal: European Journal of Philosophy
Type: Publication

## Abstract

It is normally assumed that there is only one kind of purposive action. This article argues that there are two kinds of purposive action, which require different models of explanation. One kind of action is done without awareness of reasons; another kind of action is done because the agent is aware of reasons for that action. The argument starts by noting that philosophers disagree about what explains action. Some claim that actions are explained by impersonal facts, such as facts about how things should be or have been historically (e.g. Millikan, Stout). Others claim that actions are explained by mental states, such as beliefs and desires (e.g. Davidson, Velleman). These philosophers are usually regarded as offering conflicting accounts of one thing. However, they are best understood as giving accounts of different models of action-explanation. Neither model fits every case, so there are at least two kinds of purposive action.

Title: Do Humans Have Two Systems to Track Beliefs and Belief-like States?
Authors: Ian A. Apperly and Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2009
Journal: Psychological Review
Type: Publication

## Abstract

The lack of consensus on how to characterize humans' capacity for belief reasoning has been brought into sharp focus by recent research. Children fail critical tests of belief reasoning before 3 to 4 years of age (H. Wellman, D. Cross, & J. Watson, 2001; H. Wimmer & J. Perner, 1983), yet infants apparently pass false-belief tasks at 13 or 15 months (K. H. Onishi & R. Baillargeon, 2005; L. Surian, S. Caldi, & D. Sperber, 2007). Nonhuman animals also fail critical tests of belief reasoning but can show very complex social behavior (e.g., J. Call & M. Tomasello, 2005). Fluent social interaction in adult humans implies efficient processing of beliefs, yet direct tests suggest that belief reasoning is cognitively demanding, even for adults (e.g., I. A. Apperly, D. Samson, & G. W. Humphreys, 2009). The authors interpret these findings by drawing an analogy with the domain of number cognition, where similarly contrasting results have been observed. They propose that the success of infants and nonhuman animals on some belief reasoning tasks may be best explained by a cognitively efficient but inflexible capacity for tracking belief-like states. In humans, this capacity persists in parallel with a later-developing, more flexible but more cognitively demanding theory-of-mind abilities.

Title: A Minimal Architecture for Joint Action
Authors: Cordula Vesper, Stephen A. Butterfill, Guenther Knoblich and Natalie Sebanz
Year: 2010
Journal: Neural Networks
Type: Publication

## Abstract

What kinds of processes and representations make joint action possible? In this paper, we suggest a minimal architecture for joint action that focuses on representations, action monitoring and action prediction processes, as well as ways of simplifying coordination. The architecture spells out minimal requirements for an individual agent to engage in a joint action. We discuss existing evidence in support of the architecture as well as open questions that remain to be empirically addressed. In addition, we suggest possible interfaces between the minimal architecture and other approaches to joint action. The minimal architecture has implications for theorising about the emergence of joint action, for human-machine interaction, and for understanding how coordination can be facilitated by exploiting relations between multiple agents' actions and between actions and the environment.

Title: What Does Knowledge Explain? Commentary on Jennifer Nagel
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2013
Type: Publication

## Abstract

Knowledge is a mental state: Nagel may be right about this  but wrong to suppose that knowledge is prior to belief in the sense that being able to recognize belief somehow depends on having a concept of knowledge.  This commentary identifies objections  to Nagel's arguments for priority.  Some of these objections arise from Nagel's selective use of developmental evidence on mindreading: additional findings reveal a more complex (and more interesting) picture of how abilities to recognize and track knowledge and belief develop.  If Nagel's arguments for priority fail, why hold that knowledge is a mental state?  An alternative approach might draw on arguments that intention is a mental state.  Knowledge and intention play complementary and interlocking roles in planning and practical reasoning.  Perhaps it is these roles, not claims about priority, which complicate attempts to reduce either knowledge or intention to belief or desire or some combination of these.

Title: Talking About and Seeing Blue
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2011
Event: Colour and Sensory Knowledge, IUC Philosophy of Science Conference
Type: Talk

## Abstract

Categorical perception is a pervasive and useful feature of human experience much neglected by philosophers despite illuminating psychological research on this topic.  The findings of this research on categorical perception are relevant to the truth of basic claims about which properties humans can perceptually experience and they bear on the validity of arguments about the nature of perception.  Focusing on the case of colour, this talk reviews some of the key evidence for categorical perception and extracts a characterisation.  Together with findings about the development of categorical perception of colour and its complex relations to the use of verbal labels for colour categories, this provides a basis for rejecting what Frank Jackson calls a "subject-determining platitude", namely that "'red' denotes the property of an object putatively presented in visual experience" (Jackson 1996: 200).  Categorical perception of colour differs from other forms of perception with respect to phenomenology and epistemology.  Seeing blue or red, unlike seeing the particular colours of things, does not involve the presentation in visual experience of a property.

Event: Pre-Reflective and Reflective Processing in Social Interaction
Type: Talk

## Abstract

On the assumption that social motor representation plays a role in explaining how effective joint action is possible, is there also a role for motor representation in explaining what joint action is? Philosophers tend to assume that motor representation is only an enabling condition for joint action and of no direct interest to narrowly philosophical theories of joint action and shared intention. In this talk I shall argue that social motor representation and shared intention have distinctive roles in explaining the purposiveness of joint action. This gives rise to a challenge. On the one hand, effective joint action--imagine two people erecting a tent in a gale together--sometimes requires both shared intentions and social motor representations plus a certain kind of harmony between the two. On the other hand, recognizing their distinctive roles precludes the existence of direct inferential links between shared intentions and social motor representations. The challenge is to explain how these two kinds of representation could sometimes harmoniously contribute to effective joint action despite the lack of inferential integration.

Title: Joint Action and the Emergence of Mindreading
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2011
Event: Developmental Aspects of Joint Intentions and Actions
Type: Talk

## Abstract

<p>How can we explain the emergence, in evolution or development, of sophisticated forms of theory of mind cognition?  One conjecture is that their emergence somehow involves joint action (Knoblich & Sebanz, 2006; Hughes & Leekam, 2004; Moll & Tomasello, 2007).  This raises two questions.  First, what forms of theory of mind cognition are required for joint action?  Second, how might abilities to engage in joint action be involved in the emergence of full-blown theory of mind cognition?  This talk will attempt to answer both questions.</p><p>On the first question, it is often held that all joint action involves shared intention.  This is problematic for the conjecture that abilities to engage in joint action partially explain the emergence of theory of mind cognition if, as I argue, shared intention presupposes theory of mind cognition at close to the limits of what humans are capable of.  The problem can be avoided by rejecting the assumption that all joint action involves shared intention.  I shall briefly defend an account of joint action without shared intention.  On this account, joint action presupposes only minimal theory of mind cognition.</p><p>On the second question, I shall explain how abilities to engage in joint action provide a route to knowledge of others' goals distinct from ordinary third-person interpretation.  This allows us to explain how humans are able to break into the Gricean circle and understand communicative intention.  Because communicative intention is a foundation of communication by language, and because communication by language in turn plays a role in the emergence of full-blown theory of mind cognition (Astington & Baird, 2005), this may amount to one (indirect) way in which the combination of joint action with minimal theory of mind cognition partially explains the emergence of full-blown theory of mind cognition.</p>

Title: Shared Agency and Motor Representation
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2012
Type: Talk

## Abstract

Shared agency is paradigmatically involved when two or more people paint a house together, tidy the toys away together, or lift a two-handled basket together.  To characterise shared agency, some philosophers have appealed to a special kind of intention or structure of intention, knowledge or commitment often called `shared intention'.  In this paper we argue that there are forms of shared agency characterising which requires appeal to  motor representation.  Shared agency is not only a matter of what we intend: sometimes it  constitutively involves interlocking structures of motor representation.  This may have consequences for some metaphysical, normative and phenomenological questions about shared agency.

Event: Rational Agency
Type: Talk

## Abstract

<p>Several researchers have conjectured that joint action partially explains how sophisticated* forms of cognition emerge in development or evolution (for example, Knoblich & Sebanz 2006; Moll & Tomasello 2007).  If any such conjecture is correct, what could joint action be? </p><p>The leading approach to characterising joint action focuses on shared intention (Bratman 1993, 2009).  A shared intention is something that stands to a joint action roughly as an ordinary intention stands to an individual action.  Given some widely held claims about rationality and knowledge, shared intention requires knowledge of intentions about intentions (Butterfill forthcoming).  So shared intention already presupposes sophisticated* (social) cognition.  If the conjectures about evolution and development are true, not all significant cases of joint action can involve shared intention: if they did, abilities to engage in joint action would presuppose sophisticated* forms of cognition and so could not explain how they are acquired in evolution or development.</p><p>An alternative approach to joint action starts from the claim, motivated by semantic considerations, that a joint action is an action with two or more agents (Ludwig 2007).  An immediate objection to this claim is that, given any of several widely held views about action, events standardly offered as paradigm joint actions turn out not to be joint actions at all.  This objection can be overcome by refining the claim that a joint action is an action with two or more agents.  This alternative approach is necessary for characterising the joint actions that could explain how sophisticated* forms of cognition emerge in development or evolution.</p><p>* - yes, I do realise that the term 'sophisticated' isn't very scientific; the talk will be more specific.</p>

Title: Collective Agency and Knowledge of Others’ Minds
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2013
Event: Aristotelian and Contemporary Perspectives on the Mind
Type: Talk

## Abstract

When friends walk together, they typically exercise collective agency.  By contrast, two strangers walking side by side exercise parallel but merely individual agency.  This and other contrasts invite the question, What distinguishes collective agency from parallel but merely individual agency?  To answer this question, philosophers standardly appeal to a special kind of intention or structure of intention, knowledge or commitment often called 'collective intention'.  The idea is that exercises of collective agency stand to collective intention much as exercises of ordinary, individual agency stand to ordinary, individual intention.  In this talk I shall use this parallel between individual and collective intention to argue that some forms of collective agency are grounded in representations and processes more primitive than those associated with collective intention.  Collective agency is not always a matter of what we intend: sometimes it  constitutively involves certain structures of motor representation.  One consequence is concerns a role for collective agency in explaining knowledge of others' minds.  Reflection on what is involved in sharing a smile suggests that there is a route to knowledge of others' mental states that is neither straightforwardly perceptual nor inferential but hinges on interaction.

Type: Talk

## Abstract

The success of infants and nonhuman animals on some belief reasoning tasks may be best explained by a cognitively efficient but inflexible capacity for tracking belief-like states. In humans, this capacity persists in parallel with a later-developing, more flexible but more cognitively demanding theory-of-mind abilities. The later-developing ability clearly involves meta-cognition, both because it involves thinking about thoughts as such, and because it involves at least some conscious, controlled processes. In contrast the early-developing capacity may not be conscious or controlled, and may not involve thinking about thoughts as such. We will consider how these characteristics may explain the efficiency of the early-developing capacity, and whether this means the capacity is meta-cognitive in any meaningful sense.

Title: Motor Representation in Joint Action
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2013
Event: Vision, Action and Concepts
Type: Talk

## Abstract

What do recent findings about mechanisms for interpersonal coordination reveal about the nature of joint action?  Joint action paradigmatically occurs when two or more people paint a house together, tidy the toys away together, or lift a two-handled basket.  Standard accounts of joint action invoke a special kind of intention or structure of intention, knowledge or commitment often called 'shared intention'.  Arguably, our having a shared intention requires that our plans interlock, which in turn requires that we represent each others' plans.  So, on the standard view, joint action involves representing not only what is to be done but also another's plans for doing it.  In this talk I shall explain how recent findings on mechanisms for interpersonal coordination motivate an alternative view, one that appeals to abilities to act instead of abilities to reflect on others' plans.  Rather than representing each other's plans, it is sometimes sufficient for joint action that we plan each other's actions.  (This may initially appear incoherent; I shall show that it isn't.)  Perhaps, then, there are forms of joint action characterising which requires appeal to motor representation.  Joint action is not only a matter of what we intend: sometimes it constitutively involves certain structures of motor representation.

Title: Perceiving Anger and Sharing Smiles: The Roles of Perception and Social Interaction in Acquiring Knowledge of Others’ Mental States
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2013
Event: Emotion and Social Cognition
Type: Talk

## Abstract

How could we come to know that another is angry about an obstacle she has encountered, or that she is happy about an outcome?  Some such knowledge is uncontroversially acquired by inference.  However, some philosophers have recently defended the hypothesis that knowledge of others' anger or joy might be acquired by perceiving it (e.g. Smith, 2010; McNeill, 2012a,b).  In the first part of this talk I offer a challenge to the view that humans can perceive anger or joy in the same sense that they can perceive shapes or textures.  The challenge is to specify a model of anger and other mental states which captures how these mental states appear to the perceivers.  This is a hard challenge to meet because available models arguably render mental states imperceptible.  In the second part of the talk I propose an alternative way in which knowledge of others' mental states could be acquired, one that hinges on interaction rather than perception or inference.  Reflection on what is involved in sharing a smile suggests that one route to knowledge of others' mental states might involve interacting with them.

Title: Planning for Collective Agency
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2013
Type: Talk

## Abstract

What does exercising collective agency require when our acting collectively is intentional?  On the leading, best developed account, Michael Bratman's, intentional collective agency requires shared intention and shared intention is explained in terms of interconnected planning.  For our plans to be interconnected is for them to concern not just facts about our environment and goals but also facts about each others' plans.  In this talk I shall argue that interconnected planning is neither sufficient nor necessary for intentional collective agency.  I shall also defend the possibility that parallel planning might underpin intentional collective agency.  What matters is not whether our plans are interconnected in the sense that they include facts about each others' plans: in some or all cases, what matters for intentional collective agency is rather that we each individually, in parallel plan all of our actions and so conceive of our own and each other's actions as parts of a single plan.  This may have consequences for understanding the roles of motor cognition in collective agency, as well as for modelling and simulating collective agency.

Event: Theory of Mind, Simulation and Meta-Cognition: Laureate's Colloquium with Josef Perner
Type: Talk

## Abstract

We argue that mindreading involves not only multiple systems but also multiple models (or theories) of the mind.  The argument turns on three questions.  First, how could mindreading be both flexible and efficient?  We suggest that, in a sense it can't.  Instead mindreading involves two or more systems; some trade efficiency for flexibility and others make the converse trade-off.  But how could mindreading--which paradigmatically involves constructing reason-giving, causal explanations for actions by appeal to mental states with arbitrarily nestable contents and uncodifiably complex functional roles--ever be efficient?  One possibility is that mindreading sometimes involves unsophistcated but useful models of the mind.  If this is right, we face a third question.  How can hypotheses about which model of the mind a mindreader is using be tested?   Unsophisticated models have signature limits, and these limits may make it possible to identify the operation of a given model across contexts and across types of subject.

Title: Joint Action without Mindreading
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2014
Type: Talk

## Abstract

Joint action is a familiar feature of everyday life.  Paradigmatic joint actions include things like painting a house together, walking together and playing a piano duet.  On leading accounts of joint action, engaging in joint action presupposes mindreading abilities.  But are there forms of joint action engaging in which would not require mindreading?  In this talk I aim to identify interagential structures of motor representation that play a role in coordinating some joint actions, and to argue that this role is parallel to one played by shared intention.  The parallel indicates that we can give a theoretically coherent and empirically motivated account of a form of joint action that does not require mindreading.  This  removes an obstacle to holding that abilities to engage in joint action partly explain the emergence, in evolution or development, of mindreading.

## Abstract

Joint action is a familiar feature of everyday life. Paradigmatic cases include moving objects together, walking together and playing piano duets. Many joint actions comprise two or more actions involving multiple agents which are purposive in this sense:  among all of their actual and possible outcomes, there is one or more to which the actions are collectively directed. One challenge for an account of joint action is to provide a framework for explaining in virtue of what actions involving multiple agents are collectively  directed to outcomes. A familiar way to meet this challenge is by appeal to one or another notion of shared intention. In this paper we show that more is needed to fully meet the challenge. In some cases, actions involving multiple agents are collectively directed to an outcome not in virtue of any kind of shared intention but in virtue of a certain interagential structure of motor representations. Further, some joint actions are collectively directed to outcomes partly in virtue of this interagential structure of motor representations. This suggests that the building blocks needed for constructing an account of joint action may include not only shared intention but also a certain interagential structure of motor representations.  We conclude by discussing some consequences for accounts of shared intention.

Title: Only Phenomenal Expectations Connect Core Knowledge of Objects to Thought

Year: 2015
Event: The Nature and Origins of Human Cognition
Type: Talk

## Abstract

Infants have core knowledge of objects, causes, numbers, actions and much else besides (Spelke, 2003; Carey, 2009).  But what is core knowledge?  There are challenges which apply to the leading theoretical accounts (compare Butterfill, 2007; Keren and Schul, 2009; Adolphs, 2010).  A way of responding to these challenges exists for the case of core knowledge of objects, however: several researchers have conjectured that infants’ core knowledge consists in a system of object indexes (Leslie et al. 1998; Scholl and Leslie 1999; Carey and Xu 2001; Scholl 2007). One consequence of this conjecture is the existence of an interface problem.  The representations and processes which comprise the workings of object indexes have only limited influences on thought and action.  How then could core knowledge play a role in explaining the emergence, in development, of knowledge concerning physical objects and their interactions?  One possibility hinges on the notion of a phenomenal expectation, which is approximately a sensation in Reid’s sense (Reid, 1785a,b). You have a phenomenal expectation concerning an object’s movements where these are unperceived in the most straightforward sense (because they are occluded, for example) and yet your overall experience is not neutral concerning the object’s movements either.  Perhaps the transition from core knowledge to knowledge proper has such a protracted developmental course because only phenomenal expectations connect core knowledge of objects to thoughts about objects.

Title: How Do Mindreaders Model Minds?
Authors: Stephen A. Butterfill
Year: 2015
Event: Mindreading, an invited symposium at the European Soceity for Philosophy and Psychology (ESPP)
Type: Talk

## Abstract

"What it is to be a mindreader?
Mindreading involves identifying mental states; this requires having some model of the mental, much as identifying physical states requires having some model of the physical.  
And philosophical failures to characterise minds reveal that there are multiple models of the mental, much as 
the history of science reveals that there are multiple models of the physical.  
To say that someone is a mindreader therefore leaves open the question of which model of the mental she is using.  
Just as humans use multiple models of the physical (an expert physicist will probably leave quantum mechanics behind when putting up a garden fence in favour of a model she can more efficiently deploy), so it is likely that they use multiple models of the mental.  
This may matter for understanding why mindreading is sometimes but not always automatic—some models are relatively easy to acquire or apply but are limited in accuracy, others are harder to acquire and use but also more accurate.  
But how can we test hypotheses about which model is used in a particular task?  As in the physical case, different conjectures about models of the mental can be distinguished because different models have different signature limits.
In particular, one class of models, minimal models of the mental, have signature limits involving identity.  
Recent scientific discoveries indicate that these limits can be used to confirm conjectures about how infant and adult mindreaders model minds.

## Abstract

"Two puzzles about mindreading, and in particular the nature of belief ascription, require resolution.  Can infants ascribe false beliefs in their first or second year of life?  Some measures indicate that they can, others that they cannot.  Is belief ascription automatic?  Some findings suggest that it is, others that it is not.  Reflection on these puzzling patterns of findings suggests that we should step back to ask, What it is to ascribe beliefs?  More generally, What it is to be a mindreader?  

Mindreading involves representing mental states; this requires having some model of the mental, much as representing physical states requires having some model of the physical.  The history of science reveals that there are multiple models of the physical.  Some models are relatively easy to acquire or apply but are limited in accuracy, others are harder to acquire and use but also more accurate.  The first part of this talk will show that there are also multiple models of the mental.  To say that someone represents beliefs or other mental states leaves open the question of which model of the mental she is using.  

Just as humans use multiple models of the physical (an expert physicist will probably leave quantum mechanics behind when putting up a garden fence in favour of a model she can more efficiently deploy), so it is likely that they use multiple models of the mental.  But how can we distinguish among hypotheses about which model is used in a particular task?  In the physical case, such hypotheses can be distinguished by identifying signature limits.  To illustrate, impetus mechanics makes incorrect predictions about certain trajectories.  If a certain group of individuals use impetus mechanics on a particular task, they should make incorrect predictions about these trajectories.  Testing whether they make such predictions can therefore yield evidence about which model of the physical they are using.  The second part of this talk will show that certain models of the mental have signature limits.  In particular, simpler models of the mental are limited in making incorrect predictions when beliefs essentially involve identity.  Other talks in this symposium provide evidence that, in certain cases, mindreading exhibits this signature limit.

A conjecture about how mindreaders variously model minds does not completely solve the puzzles about the automaticity and development of mindreading.  The third part of this talk concerns systems; that is, the different ways in which a model of the mind can be implemented cognitively in an actual mindreader.  It is a familiar idea that different models of the physical are implemented in different cognitive systems; representing physical states can involve core systems or modules, for example.  Representing mental states may similarly involve multiple systems.  Conjectures about multiple systems are linked to conjectures about the models they implement.  If mindreading involves multiple systems which implement multiple models of the mind, we can discover this thanks to relations between systems and models and their signature limits.

Type: Talk

## Abstract

Suppose you observe two exercises of competence in social cognition and want to know 
whether the systems underpinning the exercises are the same or distinct.  How can you tell?  An immediate obstacle is theoretical: there are many attempts to characterise ‘system’, each only slightly different from the next, and no obvious principle for deciding between competing characterisations.  You therefore cannot rely on any one theory.  Despite this obstacle, it seems to be possible to formulate hypotheses about the distinctness (or identity) of systems which generate testable predictions.  But how?  This talk aims to extract a recipe for distinguishing (or identifying) systems from research on understanding speech, action, emotion and belief.

## Abstract

How is core knowledge linked to full-blown thought and intentional action?  Infants in the first months of life have core knowledge of objects, causes, numbers, actions and much else besides (Spelke, 2003; Carey, 2009).  But what is core knowledge?  There are challenges which apply to the leading theoretical accounts (compare Butterfill, 2007; Keren and Schul, 2009; Adolphs, 2010).  One way of responding to these challenges exists for the case of core knowledge of objects, however: several researchers have conjectured that infants’ core knowledge consists in a system of object indexes (Leslie et al. 1998; Scholl and Leslie 1999; Carey and Xu 2001; Scholl 2007). Accepting this conjecture does enable us to answer challenges to the theoretical coherence of postulating core knowledge, but it also means we are confronted with a further challenge about the interface between core knowledge and thought.  The representations and processes which comprise the workings of object indexes have only limited influences on thought and action.  How then could core knowledge play a role in explaining the emergence, in development, of full-blown thought about, and intentional action on, physical objects?  I propose that one possibility hinges on the notion of a phenomenal expectation, which is approximately a sensation in Reid’s sense (Reid, 1785a,b). In general, an aspect of the overall phenomenal character of an experience is a phenomenal expectation just if its subject routinely and unthinkingly takes it to be informative about things that are only distantly related (if at all) to what experiences associated with this aspect of phenomenal character intentionally relate the subject to.  Phenomenal expectations can provide a low-cost, efficient link between core knowledge and full-blown thought and intentional action.  Perhaps the transition from core knowledge to knowledge proper has such a protracted developmental course because only phenomenal expectations connect core knowledge of objects to thoughts about objects.

## Abstract

How could we come to know that another is angry about an insult or happy about an outcome?  Some philosophers have defended the hypothesis that knowledge of others' anger or joy is sometimes perceptual (e.g. Smith, 2010, 2015; McNeill, 2012a,b).  In this talk I consider two challenges to this hypothesis.  The first challenge is to identify evidence in favour of it, or at least to explain what evidence could bear on the hypothesis.  Perhaps this challenge can be met by considering categorical perception of expressions of emotion, for which there is some evidence. The second challenge is to specify a model of anger and other mental states which captures how these mental states appear to the perceivers.  This is a hard challenge to meet because available models arguably render mental states imperceptible.  In the last part of the talk I propose an alternative way in which knowledge of others' mental states could be acquired, one that hinges on interaction rather than perception.  Reflection on what is involved in sharing a smile suggests that one route to knowledge of others’ mental states might involve interacting with them.
