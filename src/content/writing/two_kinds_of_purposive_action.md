  When we act with a purpose, are we always acting for reasons?
  * Evidence from animal learning + our own self-defeating choices shows some kinds of purposive action are information-based but unreflective;
  * these are unlike actions which occur because the agent takes the action to be reasonable.
  * The two kinds of action require different kinds of rationalising explanation.

## Abstract

It is normally assumed that there is only one kind of purposive action. This article argues that there are two kinds of purposive action, which require different models of explanation. One kind of action is done without awareness of reasons; another kind of action is done because the agent is aware of reasons for that action. The argument starts by noting that philosophers disagree about what explains action. Some claim that actions are explained by impersonal facts, such as facts about how things should be or have been historically (e.g. Millikan, Stout). Others claim that actions are explained by mental states, such as beliefs and desires (e.g. Davidson, Velleman). These philosophers are usually regarded as offering conflicting accounts of one thing. However, they are best understood as giving accounts of different models of action-explanation. Neither model fits every case, so there are at least two kinds of purposive action.
