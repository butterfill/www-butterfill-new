## Abstract

In what sense is commitment essential to joint action, and do the participants in a joint action themselves perceive commitment as essential? Attempts to answer this question have so far been hampered by clashes of intuition. Perhaps this is because the intuitions in question have mostly been investigated using informal methods only. To explore this possibility, we adopted a more formal approach to testing intuitions about joint action, sampling naïve participants’ intuitions about experimentally controlled scenarios. This approach did reveal patterns in participants’ responses which may hint at potential conceptual links between commitment and joint action. It did not however provide evidence to support the view that commitment is essential to joint action, at least not from the agents’ own perspective. We conclude that intuitions alone, even when drawn systematically from a large sample, may be a poor basis for theorizing about joint action.

<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>In recent decades, philosophers have devoted considerable effort to
investigating the phenomenon (or phenomena) of joint action.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Despite this, significant
disagreement on the basic features of joint action remains: for
instance, on whether joint action essentially involves an irreducibly
joint commitment (for example, Gilbert 2013 versus Bratman 2014); on
whether joint action essentially involves common knowledge (for example,
Bratman 2014 versus Blomberg 2016); on whether joint action essentially
involves a special kind of reasoning (Gold and Sugden 2007; Pacherie
2012), a special kind of mental state (Searle 1990; Gallotti 2011;
Gallotti and Frith 2013); or a special kind of subject (Helm 2008) as
opposed to mental states with plural subjects (Schmid 2009). Here we
focus on the issue about commitment. Our aim is to identify obstacles to
adjudicating among competing theoretical positions and to explore the
prospects for one way of overcoming the obstacles.</p>
<p>What kinds of commitment might be essential to joint action? One kind
of commitment is associated with ordinary individual intention: to
intend to do something arguably involves being committed to doing it.
Whatever kind of commitment is involved here can only be a commitment of
the subject of intention to herself; or at least, it cannot be a
commitment of anyone but the subject and it cannot be a commitment to
anyone other than the subject. One of Gilbert’s groundbreaking
contributions was to focus on a different kind of commitment she labels
‘joint commitment’. This is a commitment whereby ‘each is obligated to
all the others for performance’ (1990, p.8; cf also Gomez-Lavin &amp;
Rachar, 2019, 2021; Roth, 2004; Löhr, 2022). The question we focus on
here is whether joint action essentially involves joint commitment.</p>
<p>Clashing intuitions appear to inform disagreement on this question.
For instance, Gilbert reasons that if joint action essentially involves
joint commitment, then when agents performing joint actions are doing so
in virtue of intentions, these intentions cannot be unilaterally
rescinded. (Several routes to this view are available; see Gilbert 2009;
2013.) To illustrate, Gilbert describes a case:</p>
<p>‘The parties are Ned and Olive, and Olive is speaking: “Our plan was
to hike to the top of the hill. We arrived at the hill and started up.
As he told me later, Ned realized early on that it would be too much for
him to go all the way to the top, and decided that he would only go half
way. Though he no longer had any intention of hiking to the top of the
hill, he had as yet said nothing about this to me, thinking it best to
wait until we were at least half way up before doing so. Before then we
encountered Pam, who asked me how far we intended to go. I said that our
intention was to hike to the top of the hill, as indeed it was”’
(Gilbert 2013, p. 8).</p>
<p>Gilbert reasons that the intuitive correctness of Pam’s statement
supports the view that Ned could not unilaterally rescind their
intention, and that this in turn supports the view that joint action
essentially involves joint commitment. Elaborating on this, Gilbert
further specifies that joint commitments entail obligations; as she puts
it in her seminal (1990) paper: ‘As long as people are out on a walk
together, they will understand that each has an obligation to do what he
or she can to achieve the relevant goal’ (p.6). And more recently:
‘obligations and entitlements—not necessarily moral obligations and
rights—are inherent in acting together’<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
(2013, p. 53).</p>
<p>How compelling is Gilbert’s line of thought? Bratman’s reply is
blunt:</p>
<p>‘As I see it, once Ned has changed his mind they no longer have a
shared intention to climb to the top’ (Bratman 2014, p. 117).</p>
<p>How can we account for such stark clashes of intuition? Gilbert is
explicit that her views, like those of many philosophers, are based on
‘informal observation including self-observation’ and her ‘own sense of
the matter’ (Gilbert 2013, pp. 24, 358). It is no surprise that such
methods have not reliably led philosophers with different theoretical
positions (and potentially also different experiences and backgrounds)
to adopt compatible views.</p>
<p>In light of this, it appears that the method of relying on one’s
intuitions presents two obstacles to adjudicating among competing
theoretical positions. First, different researchers may have conflicting
intuitions (as Bratman and Gilbert appear to), or they may have no
stable intuitions at all (as is the case for the current authors). And
second, we cannot be confident that there are no extraneous personal or
cultural factors which are serving as crucial inputs to the procedures.
And yet, before writing off attempts to draw conclusions from intuitions
altogether, we should give arguments from intuitions the best chance of
success. To this end, we can follow the ground-breaking work of
Tollefsen et al (2014) and Gomez-Lavin and Rachar (2019) in moving from
informal observation to a more formal approach, and in considering the
views of a more diverse group of people than the professional
philosophers whose theories are at stake. Gomez-Lavin and Rachar (2019)
offer evidence against the existence of intuitions which, they suggest,
have been used to support Bratman’s view. As they note (p. 117), their
findings do not directly provide support for Gilbert’s view. In a
follow-up study, Gomez-Lavin and Rachar (2021) go further. Their results
suggested that participants in a joint action may feel obliged to notify
joint action partners that they are unilaterally ending participation
but not – pace Gilbert (1990; 2013) – to ask for permission to do so.
However the cogency of this interpretation of their results has been
questioned by Löhr (2022) on methodological grounds. Briefly, Löhr notes
that in asking their participants about a putative obligation to request
permission to disengage, Gomez-Lavin and Rachar ask whether they ‘have
to’ do so; by contrast, in asking about a putative obligation to notify
another of their disengagement, the experiments ask whether they
‘should’ do so (pp. 759-60). Plausibly, this difference in wording could
at least partially explain the differences in responses to those two
questions. For, as Löhr (2022, p. 759) reminds us, it is coherent to
think there are things we should do (voting in a local election,
perhaps) that we do not strictly have to do. It remains an open
question, therefore, whether Gilbert’s intuitions are widely shared
among non-philosophers.</p>
<p>In three pre-registered experiments, we set out to discover how naive
subjects categorise behaviours as involving shared intentions,
commitments and obligations. Would they follow Gilbert in identifying
cases in which there is a joint plan, but individual intentions not to
fulfil the plan, as being like cases in which there is uncontroversially
a shared intention as far as the shared intention, commitment and
obligations go (Experiments 1, 2, &amp; 3)? Or would they diverge from
Gilbert in identifying such cases as more like cases in which there is
uncontroversially no joint plan at all (Experiments 1 &amp; 2)? To test
this, we implemented scenarios spelled out by Gilbert in arguing for her
view, and stuck as closely as possible to Gilbert’s wording in
formulating our questions. By asking participants whether they agreed
with Gilbert that the agents in our test conditions had shared
intentions, commitments and obligations, we were also able to probe
whether participants’ intuitions about the relationships among these
three concepts match Gilbert’s. On Gilbert’s analysis, shared intentions
entail joint commitments as well as obligations, so responses to
questions about these should be highly correlated. On other views, in
contrast, this may not be the case – Bratman (1997; 2014), for example,
denies that shared intentions entail joint commitments or obligations,
though he does acknowledge that they may be commonly associated with
commitments and obligations to others. On other views, in contrast, this
may not be the case – Bratman (1997; 2014), for example, denies that
shared intentions entail commitments or obligations, though he does
acknowledge that they often involve commitments and obligations. It is
arguably also coherent to hold, contrary to both Gilbert and Bratman,
that shared intentions entail commitments but not obligations. This is
why we asked participants about shared intentions, commitments and
obligations.</p>
<p>In sticking as closely as possible to Gilbert’s formulations in
designing our experiments we faced a problem. The formulations are
longer and more complex than would be ideal for a psychological study in
which great weight is placed on ensuring as narrow a focus as possible
on the question of interest while minimising extraneous features,
cognitive demands and possible sources of confusion. For our purposes,
however, it would not have been appropriate to substantially alter
Gilbert’s formulations, given that this would require taking a view on
which features are extraneous, which would likely be controversial. More
importantly, our goal was to test whether the scenarios Gilbert used to
generate intuitions actually do generate the specified intuitions. Of
course if Gilbert’s scenarios do yield replicable effects it would be
important to further support the conclusions drawn with more targeted
stimuli and measures.</p>
<p>A second problem that arises from sticking to Gilbert’s formulations
is that it is possible to interpret her use of terms like ‘intention’,
‘commitment’ and ‘obligation’ as having a specialized technical use. (We
thank an anonymous reviewer for this observation.) It is possible that
non-specialists will understand these terms in a way quite different
from what Gilbert intends. We acknowledge this potential limitation (and
will return to it in the discussion). To partially address this while
avoiding the pitfalls of deviating from Gilbert’s formulations, we
substituted a more colloquial formulation (i.e. ‘We will walk to the top
of the hill.’) in Experiment 2 to replace Gilbert’s technical term
‘intention’.</p>
<p>The question of what people think about joint action has special
significance for Gilbert’s view. It is not simply that support for
Gilbert’s view might be strengthened if non-philosophers turn out to
share her intuitions about joint action. Rather, Gilbert claims that the
agents of a joint action regard themselves as committed and obligated in
virtue of being such: ‘I take it as read here that the account [of joint
action] should be such that the parties to the shared intention will
understand that they have the stated obligations, and that they
understand that this is so as a matter of what a shared intention is’
(2009, p. 175). This means that Gilbert’s theory, as formulated, entails
that ordinary people connect shared intention, commitment and obligation
in the way that she does.</p>
<p>All three experiments were approved by the (EPKEB) United Ethical
Review Board for Research in Psychology, and carried out in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants were recruited from
Prolific Academic. There were no geographical restrictions; the
experiment was open to all prolific users over the age of 18. Each
participant received 60 pence for their participation. The

<h1 id="experiment-1">2. Experiment 1</h1>
<p>In Experiment 1, we manipulated whether participants were considering
a description of joint intention with no complications (Baseline
Condition), a description of joint intention where the participants had
unilaterally and secretly decided they would abort the activity (Test
Condition), or a description involving individual, not joint, intention
(Parallel Condition). We presented three groups of participants
(<em>N</em> = 92; 35 female, 28 male, 29 unspecified<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>;
Mean age = 28.8, <em>SD</em> = 9.6) with the following three
vignettes:</p>
<p>Baseline Condition: Ned and Olive’s plan was to hike to the top of
the hill. They arrived at the hill and started up.  On the way, they
encountered Pam, who asked how far they intended to go. Olive said, ‘Our
intention is to hike to the top of the hill.’</p>
<p>Test Condition: Ned and Olive’s plan was to hike to the top of the
hill. They arrived at the hill and started up. As he told Olive later,
Ned realized early on that it would be too much for him to go all the
way to the top, and decided that he would only go half way. Though he
no longer had any intention of hiking to the top of the hill, he had as
yet said nothing about this to Olive, thinking it best to wait until he
and Olive were at least half way up before doing so. As it happens,
Olive was in the same position as Ned: she’d also decided that she would
not go all the way to the top of the hill, though she hadn’t yet
broached the subject with Ned. Before either of them got around to
raising this issue, they encountered Pam, who asked Olive how far they
intended to go. Olive said, ‘Our intention is to hike to the top of the
hill.’</p>
<p>Parallel Condition: Olive's plan was to hike to the top of the hill.
She arrived at the hill and started up. As she did so, she saw Ned ahead
of her on the path also hiking towards the top of the hill. At some
point along the way, she realized that it would be too much for her to
go all the way to the top, and decided that she would only go half way.
Along the way she ran into Ned sitting down and taking a break. Just
then Pam also appeared, who asked how far we intended to go. Olive said,
‘Our intention is to hike to the top of the hill.’</p>
<p>All participants were then presented with the following three
questions, each couched in Gilbert’s own terms in order to test her view
as directly as possible:</p>
<p>Shared Intention Question: “To what extent would you agree that
Olive’s statement to Pam at the end was accurate (i.e., ‘Our intention
is to hike to the top of the hill’)?”</p>
<p>Answers were given on a 5-point scale ranging from ‘Strongly
disagree’ to ‘Strongly agree’.</p>
<p>Commitment Question: “To what extent do you think that Ned and Olive
have a commitment to walk to the top of the hill?”</p>
<p>Answers were given on a 5-point scale ranging from ‘Strongly
disagree’ to ‘Strongly agree’.</p>
<p>Obligation Question: “To what extent do you think that Ned and Olive
have an obligation to walk to the top of the hill?”</p>
<p>Answers were given on a 5-point scale ranging from ‘Strongly agree’
to ‘Strongly disagree’.</p>
<p>We take Gilbert’s position to predict that, on each question, answers
in the baseline and test conditions should not differ, but that the test
and parallel conditions should differ; in particular, participants’
answers should be closer to ‘Strongly Agree’ in the test than in the
parallel condition.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> This is because, as mentioned above,
Gilbert holds that shared intentions entail both joint commitments and
obligations, so that both joint commitments and obligations are
established at the start of the scenario in the Baseline and Test
Conditions (but not the Parallel Condition); and also that shared
intentions, joint commitments and obligations cannot be unilaterally
rescinded.</p>
<p><em>Results</em></p>
<p>For the shared intention question, we performed a three-way Anova,
which revealed a significant effect of condition, <em>F</em> (2,87) =
25.1, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, ges= .37. We then performed post-hoc
pairwise comparisons using a Bonferroni correction (alpha = .017), which
revealed that responses in the test condition (<em>M</em>= 2.43) were
significantly lower than in the baseline condition (<em>M</em> = 4.56),
<em>t</em>(40.49) = 7.65, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>d</em> = 1.94, and
also significantly lower than in the parallel condition (<em>M</em> =
2.86), <em>t</em>(50.89)=7 , <em>p</em> &lt;.001, <em>d</em> = 0.32.
This is diametrically opposed to the pattern which Gilbert’s position
would predict.</p>
<p>For the commitment question, we performed a three-way Anova, which
revealed a significant effect of condition, <em>F</em> (2,87) = 14.00,
<em>p</em> &lt; .001, ges = .24. We then performed post-hoc pairwise
comparisons using a Bonferroni correction (alpha = .017), which revealed
that responses in the test condition (<em>M</em> = 2.43) were
significantly lower than in the baseline condition (<em>M</em> = 4.08),
<em>t</em> (53) = 5.13, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, <em>d</em> = 1.36, but did
not differ significantly from the parallel condition (<em>M</em> =
2.89), <em>t</em> (57.98)= 1.49 , <em>p</em> =.14, <em>d</em> = 0.37.
This pattern is inconsistent with Gilbert’s analysis.</p>
<p>For the obligation question, we performed a three-way Anova, which
did not reveal a significant effect of condition, <em>F</em> (2,87) =
.31, <em>p</em> = .73. We may speculate that many participants found the
term ‘obligation’ to be too strong for such a casual instance of joint
action. One possibility is that, unlike Gilbert, they may not recognize
a role for a non-moral notion of obligation in joint action. Another
possibility is that participants do recognise a non-moral notion of
obligation but, again unlike Gilbert, would not use the term
‘obligation’ to express it.</p>

<p>Next, we performed a battery of simple linear regressions to predict
responses to the shared intention question based on responses to the
commitment question, to predict responses to the shared intention
question based on responses to the obligation question, and to predict
responses to the commitment question based on responses to the
obligation question. The rationale for this was that, on Gilbert’s
analysis, shared intentions entail commitments (joint commitments more
specifically) as well as obligations, so responses to these three test
questions should be highly correlated. TThese analyses are important
insofar as they provide a further opportunity to find support for
Gilbert’s view, one that does not depend on participants finding the
scenarios we used particularly compelling. To illustrate, if
participants agree that shared intentions entail commitments then we
would expect that their answers to the question about intention predict
their answers to the question about commitment. Even if participants
were confused by the scenarios or interpret them in some unintended way,
Gilbert’s view in any case leads us to predict significant regression
equations in all three cases. The results (for all three experiments),
are summarized in Table 1.</p>

<h1 id="experiment-2">3. Experiment 2</h1>
<p>In Experiment 2, we changed only the wording of the decisive
statement in the vignette ‘Our intention is to hike to the top of the
hill’, replacing it with ‘We will walk to the top of the hill.’ The
reason for this was that talk about intention is relatively uncommon and
may have made the task unnecessarily difficult for our participants. To
illustrate this possibility, we consulted a large collection of English
language corpora (https://www.english-corpora.org/iweb/). The phrase ‘we
will’ occurs roughly 220 times more frequently than ‘our intention’.
While not decisive, this led us to suspect that the more colloquial ‘we
will’ phrasing might reduce any variance due to participants’
uncertainty about intention. This change does not alter the predictions
which derive from Gilbert’s position.</p>
<p>The sample was made up of 91 participants (23 female, 39 male, 29
unspecified; Mean age = 25.1, <em>SD</em> = 8.1).</p>
<p><em>Results</em></p>
<p>For the shared intention question, we performed a three-way Anova,
which revealed a significant effect of condition, <em>F</em> (2,88) =
39.03, <em>p</em> &lt; .001, ges= .47. We then performed post-hoc
pairwise comparisons using a Bonferroni correction (alpha = .017), which
revealed that the test condition (<em>M</em>= 2.44) differed
significantly from the baseline condition (<em>M</em>= 4.50), <em>t</em>
(42.1) = 42.06, <em>p</em>&lt; .001, <em>d</em>= 2.11, but not from the
parallel condition (<em>M</em>= 2.71), <em>t</em>(52.5)=0.96 ,
<em>p</em>=.39, <em>d</em>= 0.23. This is opposite to the pattern which
Gilbert’s view predicts.</p>
<p>For the commitment question, we performed a three-way Anova, which
revealed a significant effect of condition, <em>F</em> (2,88) = 15.88,
<em>p</em> &lt; .001, ges= .27. We then performed post-hoc pairwise
comparisons using a Bonferroni correction (alpha = .017), which revealed
that responses in the test condition (<em>M</em>= 2.93) differed
significantly from the baseline condition (<em>M</em>= 4.19), <em>t</em>
(39.3) = 4.87, <em>p</em>&lt; .001, <em>d</em>= 1.33, but did not differ
significantly from the parallel condition (<em>M</em>= 3.00),
t<em>(</em>52.7)=0.23, <em>p</em>=.82, <em>d</em>= 0.62. Again, this is
opposite to the pattern which Gilbert’s view predicts.</p>
<p>For the obligation question, we performed a three-way Anova, which
did not reveal a significant effect of condition, <em>F</em> (2,88) =
0.06, <em>p</em> = .94. As noted above, we may speculate that many
participants found the term ‘obligation’ to be too strong for such a
casual instance of joint action.</p>
<p>As for Experiment 1, we performed a battery of simple linear
regressions to predict responses to the shared intention question based
on responses to the commitment question, to predict responses to the
shared intention question based on responses to the obligation question,
and to predict responses to the commitment question based on responses
to the obligation question (See Table 1).</p>
<h1 id="experiment-3">4. Experiment 3</h1>
<p>In order to probe the robustness of our findings, we conducted
Experiment 3 with new vignettes describing a different scenario (adapted
from Gilbert, 2014). We were concerned that in the hill walking scenario
implemented in Experiments 1 and 2, participants may have felt that
either agent could walk on alone, so that commitment was not critical.
The new scenario in Experiment 3 involved a higher degree of
interdependence.</p>
<p>The two groups of participants (<em>N</em> = 63; 23 female, 26 male,
14 unspecified; Mean age = 28.1, <em>SD</em> = 12.3) were presented with
the following vignettes:</p>
<p>Baseline Condition: Roz and Dan have decided to play a 5-set tennis
match on Tuesday morning. During the second set, their friend Phil
arrives and approaches the court to greet them. Roz tells him, ‘We are
playing a 5-set match.’</p>
<p>Test Condition: Roz and Dan have decided to play a 5-set tennis match
on Tuesday morning. Midway through the second set, Roz decides that she
has had enough tennis and is going to stop after the second set. As it
happens, Dan has the very same thought, but neither of them says
anything just yet. During the second set, their friend Phil arrives and
approaches the court to greet them. Roz tells him, ‘We are playing a
5-set match.’</p>
<p>In view of the higher degree of interdependence in this scenario, we
elected not to include a parallel condition.</p>
<p>We take Gilbert’s position to predict that the baseline and test
conditions should not differ. Any evidence that they do differ would
therefore present a challenge to her theory.</p>
<p><em>Results</em></p>
<p>We first performed a t-test for the shared intention question, which
revealed that the test condition (<em>M</em>= 3.47) did not differ
significantly from the baseline condition (<em>M</em>= 3.88), <em>t</em>
(52) = 1.30, <em>p</em> = .199, <em>d</em>= 0.33. This is consistent
with Gilbert’s view.</p>
<p>We then performed a t-test for the commitment question, which
revealed that responses in the test condition (<em>M</em>= 2.83) were
significantly lower than in the baseline condition (<em>M</em>= 3.70),
<em>t</em> (60) = 2.99, <em>p</em> = .004, <em>d</em>=0.73. Gilbert’s
view provides no reason to expect this.</p>
<p>Next, we performed a t-test for the obligation question, which
revealed that the test condition (M= 2.81) did not differ significantly
from the baseline condition (<em>M</em>= 2.70), <em>t</em> (57) = 0.30,
<em>p</em>= .767, <em>d</em>= 0.08. As noted above, we may speculate
that many participants found the term ‘obligation’ to be too strong for
such a casual instance of joint action.</p>
<p>As for Experiments 1 and 2, we performed a battery of simple linear
regressions to predict responses to the shared intention question based
on responses to the commitment question, to predict responses to the
shared intention question based on responses to the obligation question,
and to predict responses to the commitment question based on responses
to the obligation question (See Table 1).</p>
<h1 id="discussion">5. Discussion</h1>
<p>Attempts to establish which, if any, forms of commitment are
essential to, rather than merely commonly associated with, joint action
have so far been hampered by clashes of intuition. This may be due in
part to the way in which intuitions have been investigated—usually
through informal, unrepeatable observations. To improve the chance that
progress in adjudicating theories can be made by reflection on
intuitions, we adopted the more systematic approach of sampling
theoretically neutral, naive participants’ intuitions about
experimentally controlled scenarios. Indeed, this approach did reveal
significant patterns in participants’ responses. Some of these patterns
were consistent with predictions of Gilbert’s view about the role of
joint commitment in joint action. In line with her view, the results of
Experiments 1 and 2 revealed that participants’ judgements about
commitment predicted their judgements about expressions of intention,
although this was not the case for Experiment 3.</p>
<p>However, other key predictions we derived from Gilbert’s view were
unsupported and, in some cases, even falsified. In particular,
participants’ judgments about obligations did not predict their
judgments about commitment in Experiments 1 and 2; although they did in
Experiment 3. Further, for the three questions in Experiments 1 and 2,
Gilbert’s view provides a reason to predict a difference between cases
in which there is a joint plan, but individual intentions not to fulfil
the plan (test condition), and cases in which there is uncontroversially
no joint plan at all (parallel condition). But we did not find any such
difference. Relatedly, for the three questions in all experiments,
Gilbert’s view provides a reason to predict no difference between cases
in which there is a joint plan but individual intentions not to fulfil
the plan (test condition), and cases in which there is uncontroversially
a shared intention. Yet we did observe very large significant
differences for the shared intention question in Experiments 1 and 2,
and for the commitment question in all three experiments. Overall, these
results indicate that a less informal approach to sampling naive
participants’ intuitions about examples does not support Gilbert’s view
on commitment and joint action.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is worth highlighting once more that our findings are
problematic for Gilbert not only because they reveal that the intuitions
on which she bases her theory are not widely shared. If this were the
case, it would be possible to dismiss the results on the grounds that
naïve participants’ intuitions are irrelevant to a philosophical
analysis. But, as we mentioned earlier, there is an additional problem:
Gilbert’s theory positively stipulates that people do understand the
relationship between shared intention, commitment and obligation in the
way she has spelled out, and that their having this understanding is
part of their capacity to have shared intentions (2009, p. 175). Of
course this problem could be avoided by revising Gilbert’s view in such
a way as to eliminate this requirement.</p>
<p>Should we therefore reject Gilbert’s view? We believe that it would
be premature to draw any firm conclusions. For one thing, we must be
cautious in drawing inferences from a narrow range of scenarios. While
it is significant that the scenarios Gilbert herself introduces to
support her view do not appear to generate the intuitions she predicts,
it remains possible that other scenarios could generate different
intuitions. In this vein, Löhr (2022) has suggested that cross-cultural
research could be helpful in teasing apart subtle differences in
people’s attitudes towards obligations.</p>
<p>But even assuming, in line with our findings, that the agents of a
joint action do not explicitly link shared intention, commitment and
obligation in the way Gilbert suggests, there are at least three
possibilities which our findings cannot rule out. One is that the
concepts are linked despite lay people’s failure to appreciate the links
without philosophical training. Another, perhaps related possibility is
that there are implicit connections among intention, commitment and
obligation; if so, implicit measures could yield a different picture
(Bonalumi et al, 2019; 2022).<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Finally, we must
acknowledge that aspects of Gilbert’s view may survive even if some
details are wrong. For instance, in our experiments both parties to the
joint action unilaterally rescinded. Gilbert may be wrong that this is
impossible but still correct that just one of the parties cannot
unilaterally rescind.</p>
<p>To conclude with a methodological point, the current study
complements recent research suggesting that intuitions alone, even when
drawn systematically from a large sample, fail to adjudicate between
competing views about the role of commitment in joint action
(Gomez-Lavin and Rachar 2019; 2021).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Looking more broadly,
there is also reason to doubt that intuitions alone can settle questions
about the nature of knowledge (e.g. Starmans and Friedman 2012; 2013).
Overall, our complex pattern of findings indicates that intuitions are
no better as a basis for theorising about joint action.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>A variety of labels have been used for what we are
calling ‘joint action’. These include ‘joint action’ (Brooks 1981;
Sebanz, Bekkering, and Knoblich 2006; Knoblich, Butterfill, and Sebanz
2011; Tollefsen 2005; Pettit and Schweikard 2006; Carpenter 2009;
Pacherie 2010; Brownell 2011; Sacheli, Arcangeli, and Paulesu 2018;
Meyer, Wel, and Hunnius 2016), ‘social action’ (Tuomela and Miller
1985), ‘collective action’ (Searle 1990; Gilbert 2010), ‘joint activity’
(Baier 1997), ‘acting together’ (Tuomela 2000), ‘shared intentional
activity’ (Bratman 1997), ‘plural action’ (Schmid 2008), an exercise of
‘joint agency’ (Pacherie 2013) or of ‘small scale shared agency’
(Bratman 2014), ‘intentional joint action’ (Blomberg 2016), ‘collective
intentional behavior’ (which is an exercise of ‘plural agency’) (Ludwig
2016), and ‘collective activity’ (Longworth 2019). We leave open whether
these are all labels for a single thing or whether different researchers
are targeting different things. We use the term ‘joint action’ for the
targets of Gilbert's analysis. We avoid potentially controversial
assumptions about exactly what these targets are because we have
implemented joint action scenarios devised by Gilbert to illustrate her
view.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Note that Gilbert is careful to acknowledge that the
obligations in question may not be of a moral nature, and that they may
be outweighed by moral obligations.<a href="#fnref2"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>This high number of unspecified responses was due to
experimenter error – i.e. this question was not administered to these 27
participants.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>We note that the views of opponents of Gilbert, such as
Bratman, do not generate relevant predictions which are distinct from
these. This is because they may allow that commitments are commonly
associated with joint action even though not essential (see Bratman
2014, pp. 110–1 for discussion) and because our Commitment Question is
formulated in a broad way and does not specify an irreducibly joint
commitment. Despite this, we chose to not formulate the Commitment
Question in terms of an irreducibly joint commitment because we were
concerned that doing so would require terminology that may be unfamiliar
to our participants. Thus the weaker formulation gives us the best
chance of confirming the predictions derived from Gilbert’s position
while admittedly limiting the strength of the conclusions we could draw
from their confirmation.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>It is worth noting that Michael et al (2016) found a
dissociation between perceived commitment and obligation using implicit
measures. However they did not explicitly contrast parallel with joint
action.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn6"><p>Although these authors endorse a stronger conclusion on
the basis of their findings (compare Gomez-Lavin and Rachar 2019,
p. 119: ‘our common intuitions are in line with a general form of the
normativist thesis …’), we are more cautious: first, because their
indicators of normativity appear as strongly present in cases of minimal
interaction as in paradigm joint actions (contra to what we suppose
either Bratman or Gilbert might predict); and second, because their
experiments are not designed to distinguish the normativist thesis from
Bratman’s competing view that norms are merely contingently associated
with acting together.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back"
