## Abstract

This book develops a mental models approach to counterfactual thinking. It brings together a large body of empirical research by the author and collaborators, and interprets the findings in the light of some novel views about meaning.  In this review, I argue that unless indicative conditional, counterfactual, and causal assertions really do all mean the same thing, the mental models discussed in <i>The Rational Imagination</i>  are not adequate for explaining counterfactual and causal reasoning.
