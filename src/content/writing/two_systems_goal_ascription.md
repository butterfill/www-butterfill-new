## Abstract

In this response to the commentary by Michael and Christensen, 
we first explain how minimal mindreading is compatible with the 
development of increasingly sophisticated mindreading behaviours 
that involve both executive functions and general knowledge, and then 
sketch one approach to a minimal account of goal ascription.
