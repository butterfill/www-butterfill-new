## Abstract

Given the premise that joint action plays some role in explaining how humans come to understand minds, what could joint action be? Not what a leading account, Michael Bratman&#39;s, says it is. For on that account engaging in joint action involves sharing intentions and sharing intentions requires much of the understanding of minds whose development is supposed to be explained by appeal to joint action. This paper therefore offers an account of a different kind of joint action, an account compatible with the premise about development. The new account is no replacement for the leading account; rather the accounts characterise two kinds of joint action. Where the kind of joint characterised by the leading account involves shared intentions, the new account characterises a kind of joint action involving shared goals.

      <p class="noindent">On the assumption that joint action plays some role in
      explaining how humans develop an understanding of minds, what could joint action
      be? This question needs a little background. It is quite widely agreed that human
      adults reflections on thoughts and actions, their own and others, involve a range
      of commonsense psychological concepts including belief, desire, intention,
      knowledge and perception. Childrens abilities to deploy these concepts improve in
      fluency and sophistication over more than three years (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_610">Bartsch &amp; Wellman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_610">1995</a>). Several
      psychologists have claimed that children first engage in joint action from around
      their first birthday and that engaging in joint action facilitates these early
      improvements (<a href="#Xen_1198">Moll &amp; Tomasello</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1198">2007</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1421">Tomasello &amp;
      Carpenter</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1421">2007</a>;&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1090">Tomasello et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1090">2005</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_557">Tomasello &amp;
      Rakoczy</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_557">2003</a>). Joint actions that young children
      engage in include tidying up the toys together (<a href="#Xen_1204">Behne
      et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1204">2005</a>), cooperatively pulling handles
      in sequence to make a dog-puppet sing (<a href="#Xen_1679">Brownell
      et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1679">2006</a>), bouncing a ball on a large
      trampoline together (<a href="#Xen_1421">Tomasello &amp;
      Carpenter</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1421">2007</a>) and pretending to row a boat
      together. The psychologists claim that engaging in joint actions like these plays
      some role in the early development of abilities to use concepts like belief,
      desire, intention, knowledge and perception, and in the development of higher
      forms of cognition more generally. My question is what joint action could be
      given that some version of this claim is true.</p><!--l. 56-->

      <p class="indent">The question arises because a leading account of joint action,
      Michael Bratman's, is incompatible with the premise. To anticipate what is
      explained in detail below, on the leading account engaging in joint action
      requires sharing intentions, and sharing intentions requires abilities to engage
      in reasoning about propositional attitudesreasoning of just the sort whose
      development was supposed to be explained by engaging in joint action. So if the
      leading account were the whole truth about joint action, engaging in joint action
      would presuppose, and therefore could not explain, much of the development of
      reasoning about others mental states. Given that the premise is true, the leading
      account cannot be the whole truth about joint action. We need a further account
      of joint action, one that is compatible with the premise that joint action plays
      a role in explaining how humans develop abilities to think about minds and
      actions. Sections 4 to 8 provide such an account. Before that, Section 2 outlines the
      leading account of joint action and Section 3 explains why this account is
      incompatible with the premise about development. <a id="x1-2001r2" name=

      "x1-30002"></a>What is joint action? The leading account</h3><!--l. 61-->

      <p class="noindent">Philosophers paradigm cases of joint action include painting
      the house together (Michael Bratman), lifting a heavy sofa together (David
      Velleman), preparing a hollandaise sauce together (John Searle), going to Chicago
      together (Christopher Kutz), and walking together (Margaret Gilbert). One aim of
      an account of joint action is to identify features of some or all of these cases
      in virtue of which they count as joint actions. In this paper I focus on Michael
      Bratman's account because, despite the clarity of its presentation, no decisive
      objection to the parts of his account outlined below has yet been published, and
      also because this account has been most influential in psychology.<span class=
      "footnote-mark"><a href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk" name="fn1x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a id="x1-3001f1" name="x1-3001f1"></a></p>
      <!--l. 71-->

      <p class="indent">Bratman characterises a kind of joint action he calls shared
      intentional activity, which is activity explainable by shared
      intention.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn2x0" id="fn2x0-bk" name=
      "fn2x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a id="x1-3002f2" name=
      "x1-3002f2"></a> This immediately leads to the question of what shared intentions
      are. Bratman's answer has two parts, a specification of the functional role shared
      intentions play and a substantial account of what shared intentions could be. On
      the first part, Bratman stipulates that the functional role of shared intentions
      is to:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 74-->

        <p class="noindent">(i) coordinate activities; (ii) coordinate planning; and
        (iii) provide a framework to structure bargaining (<a href=
        "#Xen_1356">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1356">1993</a>, p.&nbsp;99).</p>
      </div><!--l. 77-->

      <p class="noindent">To illustrate: if we share an intention that we cook dinner,
      this shared intention will (iii) structure bargaining insofar as we may need to
      decide what to cook or how to cook it on the assumption that we are cooking it
      together; the shared intention will also require us to (ii) coordinate our
      planning by each bringing complementary ingredients and tools, and to (i)
      coordinate our activities by preparing the ingredients in the right order.</p>
      <!--l. 79-->

      <p class="indent">Given this claim about what shared intentions are for, Bratman
      argues that the following three conditions are collectively
      sufficient<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn3x0" id="fn3x0-bk" name=
      "fn3x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a id="x1-3003f3" name=
      "x1-3003f3"></a> for you and I to have a shared intention that we J. This is his
      substantial account of what shared intentions could be:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 83-->

        <p class="noindent">1. (a) I intend that we J and (b) you intend that we J</p>
        <!--l. 85-->

        <p class="noindent">2. I intend that we J in accordance with and because of la,
        lb, and meshing subplans of la and lb; you intend that we J in accordance with
        and because of la, lb, and meshing subplans of la and lb</p><!--l. 87-->

        <p class="noindent">3. 1 and 2 are common knowledge between us (<a href=
        "#Xen_1356">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1356">1993</a>, p.&nbsp;View 4)</p>
      </div><!--l. 90-->

      <p class="noindent">In arguing that these are collectively sufficient conditions
      for shared intention, Bratman combines two strategies. He argues that these
      conditions collectively suffice to rule out certain cases where, intuitively,
      there is no shared intention (such as the case where we each intend to paint the
      house, I yellow and you blue). And he argues that the attitudes specified in
      these conditions are collectively capable of playing the three roles shared
      intentions are supposed to play. <a id="x1-3004r3" name="x1-3004r3"></a></p>

      "x1-40003"></a>Why shared intentional activity could not significantly foster an
      understanding of minds</h3><!--l. 96-->

      <p class="noindent">Suppose that joint action plays a role in explaining the
      early development of childrens abilities to think about minds. Is Michael
      Bratman's shared intentional activity a notion of joint action which could play
      this role? Several psychologists have suggested that it is. Thus Moll and
      Tomasello explicate their hypothesis that the unique aspects of human cognition
      were driven by, or even constituted by social cooperation (<a href=
      "#Xen_1198">2007</a>, p.&nbsp;3) by appeal to a modified version of Bratman's
      (1992) definition of shared cooperative activities [on which] the participants in
      the cooperative activity share a joint goal (<a href="#Xen_1198">2007</a>,
      p.&nbsp;3); in this context share a joint goal means possess a shared intention.
      Similarly, Carpenter, in a discussion of joint action in infancy, writes:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 99-->

        <p class="noindent">I will adopt Bratman's (1992) influential formulation of
        joint action [F]or an activity to be considered shared or joint each partner
        needs to intend to perform the joint action together in accordance with and
        because of meshing subplans (p. 338) and this needs to be common knowledge
        between the participants. (<a href="#Xen_1682">Carpenter</a>&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_1682">2009</a>, p.&nbsp;281)</p>
      </div><!--l. 102-->

      <p class="noindent">Others who appeal to Bratman's notion of shared intentional
      activity in characterising childrens first joint actions and their role in
      development include <a href="#Xen_1090">Tomasello et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;(<a href=
      "#Xen_1090">2005</a>, p.&nbsp;680) and <a href=
      "#Xen_1365">Gr&acirc;&euro;&deg;fenhain et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;(<a href=
      "#Xen_1365">2009</a>, p.&nbsp;1430).</p><!--l. 104-->

      <p class="indent">Recall that shared intentional activity requires shared
      intentions. On Bratman's substantial account, sharing intentions requires having
      intentions about intentions and even intentions about subplans of intentions (see
      Condition 2 in the quote on the preceding page). Bratman emphasises this feature
      of the account:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 107-->

        <p class="noindent">each agent does not just intend that the group perform the
        [] joint action. Rather, each agent intends as well that the group perform this
        joint action in accordance with subplans (of the intentions in favor of the
        joint action) that mesh (<a href="#Xen_1197">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_1197">1992</a>, p.&nbsp;332).</p>
      </div><!--l. 110-->

      <p class="noindent">A natural thought at this point is that joint action might
      require only plans which <span class="cmti-12">in fact</span> mesh rather than
      <span class="cmti-12">intentions about</span> the meshing of plans. Bratman
      considers this option and explains why this weakening of his account is not
      coherent (<a href="#Xen_1197">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1197">1992</a>,
      pp.&nbsp;331-3), so I shall not pursue this thought.</p><!--l. 112-->

      <p class="indent">The fact that shared intentions require intentions about
      intentions suggests a potential objection to the view that shared intentional
      activity explains early developments in childrens abilities to think about minds.
      For it seems unlikely that 2- and 3-year-olds, who according to many findings are
      years away from being able to ascribe any propositional attitudes at
      all,<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn4x0" id="fn4x0-bk" name=
      "fn4x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a id="x1-4001f4" name=
      "x1-4001f4"></a> can form intentions about others intentions.<span class=
      "footnote-mark"><a href="#fn5x0" id="fn5x0-bk" name="fn5x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">5</sup></a></span><a id="x1-4002f5" name="x1-4002f5"></a> This
      would mean they cannot meet the sufficient conditions Bratman lays out for
      sharing intentions.</p><!--l. 123-->

      <p class="indent">This potential objection is weak because it depends on
      controversial empirical claims about the absolute time in development at which
      abilities to ascribe, and to form intentions about, intentions might emerge. A
      more promising objection avoids this dependence. The ability to form intentions
      about intentions involves a sophisticated kind of propositional attitude
      ascription (as explained below). This ability is required for sharing intentions
      in accordance with Bratman's substantial account. So meeting the sufficient
      conditions for joint action given by this account could not significantly
      <span class="cmti-12">explain</span> the development of an understanding of minds
      because it already <span class="cmti-12">presupposes</span> too much
      sophistication in the use of psychological concepts.<span class=
      "footnote-mark"><a href="#fn6x0" id="fn6x0-bk" name="fn6x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">6</sup></a></span><a id="x1-4003f6" name="x1-4003f6"></a></p>
      <!--l. 125-->

      <p class="indent">Note that, as it stands, this objection does not establish
      much. It concerns conditions imposed by the substantial account of shared
      intention which are sufficient but not necessary conditions.<span class=
      "footnote-mark"><a href="#fn7x0" id="fn7x0-bk" name="fn7x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">7</sup></a></span><a id="x1-4004f7" name="x1-4004f7"></a> The
      substantial account is supposed to characterise oneperhaps one among manyways in
      which the functional role of shared intentions can be realised. So the objection
      serves only to raise a question. Are there in fact alternative sufficient
      conditions for shared intention, conditions that can be met without already
      having abilities to use psychological concepts whose development was supposed to
      be explained by joint action?</p><!--l. 131-->

      <p class="indent">The answer to this question is not entirely straightforward. We
      must begin with the functional roles of shared intention, for these provide
      necessary conditions. One of the roles of shared intentions is to coordinate
      planning. What does coordinating planning involve? Intuitively the idea is that
      just as individual intentions serve to coordinate an individuals planning over
      time, so shared intentions coordinate planning between agents. (I use the terms
      individual intention and individual goal to refer to intentions and goals
      explanatory of individual actions; an individual action is an action performed by
      just one agent such as that described by the sentence Ayesha repaired the
      puncture all by herself.) A second role for shared intentions is to structure
      bargaining concerning plans. To understand these roles it is essential to
      understand what planning means in this context. The term planning is sometimes
      used quite broadly to encompass processes involved in low-level control over the
      execution of sequences of movements, as is often required for manipulating
      objects manually (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1535">Haggard</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1535">1998</a>), as well as processes controlling the movements of a limb
      on a single trajectory (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1681">Bizzu</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1681">2001</a>). In Bratman's account and this paper, the term planning is
      used in a narrower sense. Planning in this narrow sense exists to coordinate an
      agents various activities over relatively long intervals of time; it involves
      practical reasoning and forming intentions which may themselves require further
      planning, generating a hierachy of plans and subplans. Paradigm cases include
      planning a birthday party or planning to move house.</p><!--l. 133-->

      <p class="indent">Given the functional roles of shared intention, when (if ever)
      must the states which realise shared intentions include intentions about others
      intentions? Coordinating plans with others does not seem always or in principle
      to require specific intentions about others intentions. It is plausible that in
      everyday life some of our plans are coordinated largely thanks to a background of
      shared preferences, habits and conventions. Consider, for example, people who
      often meet in a set place at a fixed time of day to discuss research over lunch.
      These people can coordinate their lunch plans merely by setting a date and
      following established routine; providing nothing unexpected happens, they seem
      not to need intentions about each others intentions. Within limits, then,
      coordinating plans may not always require intentions about intentions. The same
      may hold for structuring bargaining. But when the background of shared
      preferences, habits and conventions is not sufficient to ensure that our plans
      will be coordinated, it is necessary to monitor or manipulate others plans. And
      since intentions are the basic elements of plans (in the special sense of plan in
      terms of which Bratman defined shared intention), this means monitoring or
      manipulating others intentions. The background which makes for effortlessly
      coordinated planning is absent when our aims are sufficiently novel, when the
      circumstances sufficiently unusual (as in many emergencies), and when our
      co-actors are sufficiently unfamiliar. In all of these cases, coordinating plans
      and structuring bargaining will involve monitoring or manipulating others
      intentions. Now this does not necessarily involve forming intentions about their
      intentions because, in principle, monitoring and manipulating others intentions
      could (within limits) be achieved by representing states which serve as proxies
      for intentions rather than by representing intentions as such, much as one can
      (within limits) monitor and manipulate others visual perceptions by representing
      their lines of sight. But possession of general abilities to monitor and
      manipulate others intentions does require being able to form intentions about
      others intentions.</p><!--l. 135-->

      <p class="indent">The question was whether there are sufficient conditions for
      shared intention which do not presuppose abilities to use psychological concepts
      whose development is supposed to be explained by joint action. As promised, the
      answer is not straightforward. In a limited range of cases, coordinating plans
      and perhaps structuring bargaining does not appear to require insights into other
      minds. But in other cases, particularly cases involving novel aims or agents
      unfamiliar with each other, intentions about others intentions are generally
      required.</p><!--l. 137-->

      <p class="indent">The main question for this section was whether Bratman's account
      captures a notion of joint action suitable for explaining the early development
      of childrens abilities to think about minds. Some of the joint actions which
      young children engage in involve novel aims, and some involve unfamiliar
      partners. So if these joint actions did involve coordinating planning and
      structuring bargaining, they could not rest on a shared background but would
      require abilities to form intentions about others intentions. It follows that
      joint action would presuppose much of the sophistication in the use of
      psychological concepts whose development it was supposed to explain. So given the
      premise that joint action plays a role in explaining early developments in
      understanding minds, it cannot be the case that the joint actions children engage
      in as soon as they engage in any joint actions involve shared intentions as
      characterised by Bratman.</p><!--l. 139-->

      <p class="indent">This conclusion rests on the assumption that having intentions
      about intentions involves some of the psychological sophistication whose
      development is supposed to be explained by appeal to joint action. One might
      object that the ability for form intentions about intentions is somehow less
      sophisticated than abilities to form other kinds of representation of other kinds
      of mental states. To answer the objection it is sufficient to clarify what
      intention means in this context. For the term intention, like planning, is used
      to mean different things by different researchers. Sometimes intention and goal
      are used interchangeably in describing behaviour which is somewhat flexibly
      organised around some outcome (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1433">Premack</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1433">1990</a>, p.&nbsp;14). But in
      this context we need a different notion of intention, one on which intentions are
      elements of plans. Such intentions play a role in coordinating an agents
      activities over time. Their role is characterised in part by normative
      constraints expressed in terms of the propositional contents of intentions. For
      instance, one norm characteristic of the role of intentions in plans requires an
      agent to avoid ways of realising one intention that will make it impossible for
      her to realise other intentions she has (all things being equal). This norm
      requires someone who intends both to visit an aunt and to buy some shoes in a
      single evening to limit time spent on each activity to allow for the other.
      Another norm characteristic of intention concerns the compatibility of having
      multiple intentions simultaneously: it is not rational to have multiple
      intentions unless it is rational to have a single intention agglomerating them
      all (<a href="#Xen_1543">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1543">1987</a>). Norms
      such as these, together with the role of intentions in practical reasoning, are
      what characterise the role of intentions in planning. Given that intentions are
      characterised in this way as elements in plans, it seems necessary that
      understanding intentions will involve some grasp both of the role that intentions
      as propositional attitudes play in practical reasoning and also of the norms
      relating intentions to planning. Of course this does not mean that individuals
      who understand intentions as elements in plans can articulate or list the
      relevant roles or norms. But it does mean that they should sometimes be sensitive
      to some of the requirements these norms impose and also that they would be able
      to recognise some of the norms as correct in optimal conditions. This is why
      requiring intentions about intentions presupposes significant psychological
      sophistication.</p><!--l. 141-->

      <p class="indent">Given that joint action facilitates the development of mental
      understanding, and that (as just argued) Bratman's notion of shared intentional
      activity is not a kind of joint action which could play this role, does it follow
      that Bratman's account is incorrect?<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn8x0"
      id="fn8x0-bk" name="fn8x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">8</sup></a></span><a id="x1-4005f8" name="x1-4005f8"></a>
      Drawing this conclusion would require the further assumption that there is just
      one kind of joint action. This is not obviously true. Compare individual action.
      It is sometimes accepted that there is a distinction between intentional action
      and other kinds of action such as response behaviours and merely purposive
      activities (<a href="#Xen_496">Dickinson &amp; Balleine</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_496">2000</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_194">Frankfurt</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_194">1971</a>). Because there may be an analogous distinction between kinds
      of joint action, the developmental considerations do not directly bear on the
      correctness of Bratman's account. Perhaps what we need is not a modified version
      of Bratman's account but an account of a different kind of joint action.</p>
      <!--l. 143-->

      <p class="indent">To sum up, Bratman's account does not characterise a kind of
      joint action which could play a role in explaining how children come to
      understand minds. In the next section I consider whether this undermines the
      claim that the interactions highlighted by developmental psychologists are really
      joint actions before offering a new account of joint action in the following
      sections. <a id="x1-4006r4" name="x1-4006r4"></a></p>

      <!--l. 149-->

      <p class="noindent">The argument of the previous section establishes that not all
      of the following claims are true:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 152-->

        <p class="noindent">(1) joint action fosters an understanding of minds;</p>
        <!--l. 154-->

        <p class="noindent">(2) all joint action involves shared intention; and</p>
        <!--l. 156-->

        <p class="noindent">(3) a function of shared intention is to coordinate two or
        more agents plans.</p>
      </div><!--l. 159-->

      <p class="noindent">These claims are inconsistent because if the second and third
      were both true, abilities to engage in joint action would presuppose, and so
      could not significantly foster, an understanding of minds. For all that has been
      said so far, any of these claims could be rejected. In what follows I
      characterise a form of joint action which involves what I call shared goals and
      no shared intentions. The aim is to show by construction that there are forms of
      joint action which require minimal cognitive sophistication. In doing this I
      shall provide grounds for rejecting the claim that joint action always involves
      shared intention, (2), strengthening the case for accepting the premise about
      development, (1), while remaining neutral on whether shared intentions function
      to coordinate planning, (3).</p><!--l. 161-->

      <p class="indent">Some researchers assert that all joint actions involve shared
      intentions. For instance, Tomasello writes that [t]he sine qua non of
      collaborative action is a joint goal and a joint commitment (<a href=
      "#Xen_1828">2008</a>, p.&nbsp;181). Here joint goal refers to shared intention in
      Bratman's sense and collaborative action includes joint actions early in
      development. Similarly, Gilbert writes I take collective action to involve a
      collective intention (<a href="#Xen_1287">2006</a>, p.&nbsp;5). Perhaps, then, a
      better strategy than the one I propose would be to reject the first claim, (1),
      above and conjecture that joint action cannot significantly foster an
      understanding of minds (although some lesser form of interaction may do so). But
      it is striking that none of the researchers who assert that all joint action
      involves shared intention provide an argument, and narrowly semantic
      considerations provide no support for this assertion (<a href=
      "#Xen_2394">Ludwig</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_2394">2007</a>;&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_2395">Smith</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_2395">2011</a>, p.&nbsp;367). In fact
      other researchers have assumed without argument that not all joint actions
      involve shared intention (<a href="#Xen_1197">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1197">1992</a>, p.&nbsp;330; <a href="#Xen_1860">Schmidt

      "#Xen_1778">Vesper et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1778">2010</a>). On what
      grounds could we accept this assumption or its negation?</p><!--l. 165-->

      <p class="indent">Let us step back. What features other than shared intention
      indicate that the actions of two or more agents constitute a joint action as
      opposed to any other kind of interaction? Here are several indicators of joint
      action:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 168-->

        <p class="noindent">i. this case seems to fit with paradigm examples of joint
        action such as walking, cooking or playing the piano together (<a href=
        "#Xen_1861">Gilbert</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1861">1990</a>;&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_2392">Goebl &amp; Palmer</a>&nbsp;<a href=

        "#Xen_25">2000</a>);</p><!--l. 170-->

        <p class="noindent">ii. the candidate joint action differs from a case in which
        the agents perform the same type of activity (such as walking or cooking) in
        parallel rather than together (<a href="#Xen_1768">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_1768">2009</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1861">Gilbert</a>&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_1861">1990</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1365">Gr&acirc;&euro;&deg;fenhain
        et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1365">2009</a>, p.&nbsp;150);</p>
        <!--l. 172-->

        <p class="noindent">iii. for each agent, acting together rather than
        individually is voluntary in this sense: in so far as they control which means
        they adopt in pursuing a goal, such as whether to move an object by lifting it
        or by dragging it, they can also control whether their actions are individual
        or joint;</p><!--l. 174-->

        <p class="noindent">iv. there is a sense in which all of the agents actions
        taken together are directed to a single goal, and this is not just a matter of
        each agents action being individually directed to that goal;</p><!--l. 176-->

        <p class="noindent">v. there is a description of the interaction with a plural
        subject and an action verb, such as they are bouncing the ball on the
        trampoline (<a href="#Xen_1290">Kutz</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1290">2000</a>
        emphasises this indicator);</p><!--l. 178-->

        <p class="noindent">vi. each agent is disposed to modify her actions in
        accordance with what is needed to achieve the goal given how the other agents
        actions are unfolding (<a href="#Xen_1197">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href=
        "#Xen_1197">1992</a>, p.&nbsp;328).</p>
      </div><!--l. 181-->

      <p class="noindent">I am not suggesting that any of these features is necessary
      for joint action, nor that they are collectively sufficient. My claim is just
      these features are relevant to deciding whether an interaction is a joint action,
      and that where an interaction has many or all of these features we have
      (defeasible) grounds to infer that it is a joint action. In short, I propose
      that, in the absence of a deeper analysis, we should take these features as a
      rough and provisional explication of one theoretically significant way of using
      the term joint action.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn9x0" id="fn9x0-bk"
      name="fn9x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">9</sup></a></span><a id="x1-5001f9"
      name="x1-5001f9"></a></p><!--l. 183-->

      <p class="indent">So what about the objection that all joint action involves
      shared intention? The following will provide (defeasible) grounds for rejecting
      it. For I shall show that some interactions have the features listed above,
      (i)-(vi), but do not involve shared intention. <a id="x1-5002r5" name=
      "x1-5002r5"></a></p>

      <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.</span> <a id="x1-60005" name=
      "x1-60005"></a>Plural activities</h3><!--l. 189-->

      <p class="noindent">Our question is what joint action could be on the assumption
      that it fosters an understanding of minds. We have seen (in Section 3) that the
      answer cannot involve appeal to shared intention. Joint actions involving shared
      intention presuppose, and so cannot significantly foster the development of,
      sophisticated uses of psychological concepts. What we need, then, is to identify
      a form of joint action that requires as little psychological sophistication as
      possible; by presupposing less we make it possible to explain more.</p>
      <!--l. 191-->

      <p class="indent">I shall approach this task indirectly by first considering
      forms of action involving multiple agents more basic than any kind of joint
      action. Some ants harvest plant hair and fungus in order to build traps to
      capture large insects; once captured, many worker ants sting the large insects,
      transport them and carve them up (<a href="#Xen_1292">Dejean
      et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1292">2005</a>). The ants behaviours have an
      interesting feature distinct from their being coordinated: each ants behaviours
      are individually organised around an outcomethe flys deathwhich occurs as a
      common effect of many ants behaviours. We can say that there is a single
      activitykilling a flywhich several ants performed. In general, a plural activity
      is one involving two or more agents. As I shall use the term plural activity, for
      agents to be engaged in a plural activity it is sufficient that each agents
      activities are individually organised around a single outcome which occurs as a
      common effect of all the agents activities.</p><!--l. 193-->

      <p class="indent">Note that nothing controversial is assumed in stating these
      sufficient conditions for plural activity. The first ingredient is the notion
      that an individuals behaviours can be organised around an outcome. This is
      shorthand for an open-ended disjunction of cases; it means that there is an
      intention, habit, biological function or other behaviour-organizing circumstance
      connecting the individuals behaviours to the outcome. The second ingredient is
      the notion of a common effect, which is not specific to action. The flys capture
      is a common effect of the ants individual behaviours in just the sense that the
      flys death is a common effect of the multiple doses of poison it received: none
      of the doses was individually deadly, each had its murderous effect only in
      concert with some of the others. As characterised here, the notion of a plural
      activity depends on nothing more controversial than the cogency of these two
      ingredients.</p><!--l. 195-->

      <p class="indent">My use of the term plural activity is different from other
      natural uses of this term and may be too broad to pick out an intuitive category.
      If Helen and Ayesha individually aim to smooth a section of pavement by shuffling
      their feet when they walk over it and if it does become smooth partly as a
      consequence of both their efforts, then they are engaged in the plural activity
      of smoothing the pavement. This is true even in the absence of any intention to
      act together. It is true even if their lives do not overlap at all, so that there
      may be no intuitive sense in which their smoothing the pavement is a joint
      action. Allowing this case to count as a plural activity does no harm for present
      purposes and makes it possible to characterise a useful notion of plural activity
      in uncontroversial terms.</p><!--l. 197-->

      <p class="indent">Another potentially unnatural feature of this definition of
      plural activity is that it requires success. By definition, where two or more
      agents actions constitute a plural activity the outcome to which they are
      directed must occur. This simplifies the definition in ways that will shortly be
      useful.</p><!--l. 199-->

      <p class="indent">Humans sometimes perform activities that are plural in the
      minimal sense that some ants behaviours are. In a particularly sulky mood Thomas
      pulls on one end of a large boat in order to move it; he does not realise that
      Illaria is pushing the other end and that without her contribution the boat would
      not move. He succeeds in moving the boat, as does Illaria. So there is a single
      activitymoving the boatwhich they both perform. Even though Thomas action is
      goal-directed (its goal is to move the boat to the sea), his activity is plural
      only in the minimal sense that the ants fly-trapping behaviour is: it is
      organised around an outcome which occurs as a common effect. The plural nature of
      such activities need not show up in intentions, desires or beliefs. That an
      activity is performed by two individuals does not require that they intend,
      believe or desire this to be so.</p><!--l. 201-->

      <p class="indent">What most philosophers mean by joint action is not, or not
      only, this minimal notion of plural activity. Certainly this minimal notion is
      inadequate for our present purpose, which is to understand what joint action
      could be on the assumption that it plays some role in explaining how children
      come to understand minds. Nevertheless, the notion of plural activity is a useful
      starting point for understanding a kind of joint action relevant to explaining
      development. <a id="x1-6001r6" name="x1-6001r6"></a></p>

      <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.</span> <a id="x1-70006" name=
      "x1-70006"></a>What is the function of shared goals?</h3><!--l. 206-->

      <p class="noindent">In giving an account of one kind of joint action I shall
      first identify something I call shared goals. Before starting it will be helpful
      to fix terminology. As I use the term goal it refers to an outcome, actual or
      possible, and not to a state. I make no direct use of the notion that agents can
      have goals (as in Sams goal was to topple the president) and focus on relations
      between goals and actions (as in the goal of Marvins action was to upset Ayesha).
      An action is <span class="cmti-12">goal-directed</span> where it makes sense to
      ask which of its possible and actual outcomes are goals to which the action was
      directed. One paradigm case of goal-directed action involves intention: where an
      agent acts on an intention, the intentions content specifies a goal to which her
      action is directed. In addition, an action can arguably be directed to a goal
      which is not specified in the content of any of the agents intentions (<a href=
      "#Xen_1359">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1359">1984</a>). There may also be
      forms of action which are goal-directed but do not involve intention at
      all.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn10x0" id="fn10x0-bk" name=
      "fn10x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">10</sup></a></span><a id="x1-7001f10"
      name="x1-7001f10"></a> Certainly there are ways of representing actions as
      goal-directed which do not involve representing intentions or any other
      propositional attitudes of agents.</p><!--l. 208-->

      <p class="indent">The term shared is used loosely. Just as, on most accounts,
      shared intentions are neither literally intentions nor literally shared (no
      single intention is mine and yours), so shared goals are not goals (they are
      complexes of states and relations) and do not by definition alone involve
      anything which is literally shared. I have used the otherwise infelicitous label
      shared goal in order to highlight the basic intuition behind the positive account
      of joint action I shall offer: some cases of joint action involve structures
      which bind not the agents intentions but the goals to which their activities are
      directed.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn11x0" id="fn11x0-bk" name=
      "fn11x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">11</sup></a></span><a id="x1-7002f11"
      name="x1-7002f11"></a></p><!--l. 210-->

      <p class="indent">Having fixed terminology we can now turn to the primary issue,
      which is to identify shared goals. Following the model provided by Bratman's
      account of shared intentions, my account of shared goals has two parts: a
      specification of their function role and a substantial description of states that
      could realise them. This section is about the functional role of shared goals,
      the following section concerns their realisation. To emphasise, questions about
      the mental states involved in sharing goals will be deferred until the next
      section; in this section the question is only what shared goals are for.</p>
      <!--l. 212-->

      <p class="indent">Successful plural activity generally requires coordination. How
      is this coordination achieved? In the case of ants such coordination may be
      achieved hormonally. In humans, who can voluntarily engage in plural activities
      with novel outcomes, coordination can usually only be achieved psychologically.
      This is what shared goals are for. Shared goals coordinate multiple agents
      goal-directed activities around an outcome to be achieved as a common effect of
      their efforts. That is, their function is to coordinate plural activities.</p>
      <!--l. 214-->

      <p class="indent">An illustration may help to clarify what performing this
      function amounts to. There is a fallen tree lying across the road. Several people
      each want it moved, but none of them can move it by themselves and none of them
      can control the others actions. The trees movement can only be secured as common
      effect of several peoples actions. In this situation, there is a need for several
      people to coordinate their goal-directed activities. They need to lift in
      complementary directions and at suitably related times; and if lifting doesnt
      work, they need to change strategy and try pushing or something else that might
      achieve the outcome. The role of shared goals is to coordinate these
      goal-directed activities.</p><!--l. 216-->

      <p class="indent">In the above illustration, plural activity is necessary to
      achieve an outcome. Shared goals also play a role in situations where plural
      activity occurs even though it is not necessary. For instance, Amin and Bertram
      each individually aim to put a large barrel into a boat. Either of them could
      move the barrel into the boat alone or their doing this could be a plural
      activity; the choice is theirs. The sequence of activities Amin would need to
      perform to put the barrel in the boat differs depending on whether he is acting
      alone or with Bertram. Acting alone, Amin would position himself so that the
      barrel and boat are in front of him, throw his arms around the middle of barrel,
      raise it, tilt back and then push up and forwards. If he chose to act with
      Bertram, Amin would need to take an entirely different approach. It is this need
      that shared goals answer.</p><!--l. 218-->

      <p class="indent">The notion that a function of shared goals is to coordinate
      goal-directed activities needs qualifying because all action involves
      coordination at several levels. Any goal-directed action, individual or joint,
      will be realised by a collection of simple object-directed actions such as
      pushing, pulling and tearing; and these in turn will be realized by some kind of
      motor actions, and so on until at some point we reach continuous bodily
      movements. Plainly most tasks require coordination at several of these levels;
      for instance, passing an object from one hand to another requires precise timing
      of releases and grasps as well as appropriate positioning in space. At some
      levels, coordination is largely independent of which goals agents actions are
      directed to (for example, it can be hard to use ones hands in an uncoordinated
      way even when doing so would be advantageous). This is true even for coordination
      of multiple agents activities. We may coordinate with others without being aware
      of how we are coordinating or even that we are coordinating (<a href=
      "#Xen_1693">Richardson et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1693">2009</a>). In
      fact there seem to be several forms of <span class="cmti-12">emergent
      coordination</span>, that is, coordination which is independent of the goals of
      an agents actions (<a href="#Xen_1812">Knoblich et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1812">2010</a>). Clearly, then, shared goals are not the only factor in
      coordinating plural activity. The role of shared goals is limited to coordinating
      goal-directed actions and not their non-purposive components, and it may be that
      shared goals can play this role only thanks to the existence of other mechanisms
      of emergent coordination.</p><!--l. 220-->

      <p class="indent">Shared goals resemble shared intentions insofar as both exist
      to coordinate activities. They differ in that structuring bargaining and
      coordinating planning are not functions of shared goals. On some views, the
      distinction I have drawn between shared intentions and shared goals parallels a
      distinction between individual intentions and more primitive states connecting
      individuals activities with the goals to which they are directed. For individual
      intentions are sometimes held to be intrinsically elements in agents plans and
      therefore absent from the lives of any agents incapable of planning (<a href=
      "#Xen_1694">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1694">2007</a>). Such agents (if there
      are any) may need to act when faced with equally desirable alternatives and to
      coordinate their activities around goals despite fluctuations in desire. This
      need might be met by states which resemble intentions in that they exist in part
      to coordinate a single agents activities and in that they connect the agents
      activities to a goal, but differ from intentions in lacking planning functions.
      Given this distinction, shared intentions would stand to shared goals roughly as
      individual intentions stand to their more primitive counterparts.</p>
      <!--l. 222-->

      <p class="indent">The limited function of shared goals makes them better suited
      than shared intentions for characterising the cases studied in developmental
      research. Many, perhaps all, of these cases would not normally require
      coordinated planning. As mentioned above, these cases include tidying up the toys
      together and cooperatively pulling handles in sequence in order to make a puppet
      sing. As coordinated planning is not needed in such cases, nor are shared
      intentions. What is needed, though, is for the agents goal-directed actions to be
      coordinated. This is what shared goals are for. <a id="x1-7003r7" name=

      <p class="noindent">In the previous section I identified shared goals in terms of
      their function, which is to coordinate plural activities. The next step is to
      characterise states capable of realising this function.</p><!--l. 229-->

      <p class="indent">To start with an illustration, suppose that a goal of Amins
      actions in the near future will be move a large barrel into a boat. Amin
      anticipates that some of Bertrams future actions will have the same goal, and
      Amin expects the barrels moving into the boat to occur as a common effect of his
      own goal-directed actions and Bertrams. For his part, moving the barrel into the
      boat will also be a goal of Bertrams actions and Bertram has expectations
      mirroring Amins. In favourable circumstances their goal-directed contributions to
      a plural activity of moving the barrel into the boat could be coordinated in
      virtue of this pattern of goal-relations and expectations. Accordingly, the
      existence of such goal-relations and expectations are sufficient for Amin and
      Bertram to share the goal of getting the barrel into the boat.</p><!--l. 231-->

      <p class="indent">Here are the key features of this case expressed in general
      terms:</p>

        <p class="noindent">(d) <span class="cmti-12">expectations about a common

        <p class="noindent">on balance each agent expects this goal to occur as a
        common effect of all of their actions directed to the goal, her own and the
        others.</p>
      </div><!--l. 253-->

      <p class="noindent">In favourable circumstances and in concert with emergent
      coordination, these goal-relations and expectations could serve to coordinate the
      goal-directed plural activities of two or more agents (I shall say which
      circumstances are favourable below). Since shared goal was defined in terms of
      this coordinating function, (a)-(d) are collectively sufficient for possessing a
      shared goal.</p><!--l. 255-->

      <p class="indent">Let us consider these four features in turn. The first feature,
      (a), is required just because we are concerned with plural activities; by
      definition, actions comprising a plural activity are directed to a single goal
      such as moving a particular barrel onto a certain boat (see Section 4). The
      second feature, (b), was not explicit in the description of Amin and Bertrams
      barrel moving. It excludes the following sort of case. Mia and Sobani are in a
      crowded space. Each intends to move a table and, thanks to her background
      knowledge, expects that exactly one other agent intends the same. But neither Mia
      nor Sobani can identify who else she expects to be involved in moving the table,
      except trivially as the other table-mover. In this case, the pattern of
      goal-relations and expectations in (a), (c) and (d) could have at most a limited
      effect on Mia and Sobanis ability to coordinate their efforts. So the
      identification requirement, (b), is included because the coordinating effect of
      (a), (c) and (d) seem to depend on it. Identification may not feature whenever
      agents have a shared goal; (a)-(d) collectively provide only sufficient
      conditions.</p><!--l. 257-->

      <p class="indent">The third and fourth features, (c) and (d), involve
      expectations. Knowledge states and beliefs both count as expectations but it is
      not necessary to have either. In developmental research, looking times and eye
      movements are regularly used as measures of infants expectations concerning goals
      (for example&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1434">Csibra et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1434">2003</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1436">Gergely &amp;
      Csibra</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1436">2003</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1207">Gergely
      et&nbsp;al.</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1207">1995</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1437">Luo
      &amp; Baillargeon</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1437">2005</a>;&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1439">Woodward &amp; Sommerville</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1439">2000</a>). It
      is an open question whether these sorts of expectations are beliefs. Where such
      expectations do not merely control looking times and eye movements but also
      inform a range of goal-directed actions in ways that are rational given their
      contents, then expectations of this type are sufficient for sharing goals whether
      or not they amount to beliefs. This marks one contrast between requirements on
      sharing goals and sharing intentions. Given that intentions function to
      coordinate planning in Bratman's intellectual sense of planning and given some
      plausible norms governing the rationality of planning (<a href=
      "#Xen_1774">Hawthorne</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1774">2004</a>, pp.&nbsp;29-31),
      sharing an intention will require knowledge of others intentions and their
      relations to ones own. By contrast, sharing a goal does not require knowledge.
      because several kinds of expectation which fall short of knowledge are sufficient
      for coordinating plural activities.</p><!--l. 259-->

      <p class="indent">The third feature, (c), concerns expectations about other
      agents goal-directed actions. This is a minimal counterpart of the requirement
      that agents who share an intention represent each others intentions. Possessing a
      shared goal requires representing only goal-directed actions. It is possible to
      represent an action as goal-directed without representing (or even being able to
      represent) intentions or any other propositional attitudes. For instance, an
      agent might represent goals as functions of actions.<span class=
      "footnote-mark"><a href="#fn13x0" id="fn13x0-bk" name="fn13x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">13</sup></a></span><a id="x1-8002f13" name="x1-8002f13"></a>
      There are strong theoretical and empirical grounds to hold that representing
      goal-directed actions requires less conceptual sophistication, and may be less
      cognitively demanding, than representing intentions as such.</p><!--l. 265-->

      <p class="indent">The fourth feature, (d), concerns the agents expectations that
      the goal to which their actions are directed will occur as a common effect of
      their efforts. This and the third feature are jointly equivalent to requiring
      that the each agent expects that she and the other agents are engaged in a plural
      activity with goal G. (The agents may not actually be engaged in a single plural
      activity because, as noted earlier, plural activities are by definition
      successful whereas it is possible to possesses a shared goal without succeeding.)
      The claim that features (a)-(d) are sufficient for agents to possess a shared
      goal is the claim that this combination of features could function to coordinate
      plural activities. In essence, the claim is this: an expectation, on the part of
      each agent concerned, that she is or will be involved in a plural activity with
      the others, will, in favourable circumstances and in concert with emergent
      coordination, normally enable them to coordinate their actions.</p><!--l. 267-->

      <p class="indent">Shared intention is sometimes thought to involve common
      knowledge in such a way that agents who share an intention can know that they
      share an intention.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn14x0" id="fn14x0-bk"
      name="fn14x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">14</sup></a></span><a id=
      "x1-8003f14" name="x1-8003f14"></a> By contrast, it is possible to have a shared
      goal without knowing that one does. Agents can have, and act on (see Section 8
      below), a shared goal without understanding their actions as comprising anything
      more than a plural activity.</p><!--l. 273-->

      <p class="indent">The above pattern of goal-relations and expectations, (a)-(d),
      can play its coordinating role only in favourable circumstances. What makes
      circumstances <span class="cmti-12">un</span>favourable? One factor is a lack of
      freedom. To illustrate, suppose that Hendrik and Arch are instructed to tidy the
      toys away. Arch would not normally obey this instruction but Hendrik convincingly
      threatens reprisals unless Arch tidies all the toys away. For the goal of tidying
      the toys away, (a)-(d) above could all obtain in this case (Hendrik fulfils (a)
      by the act of threatening). But any coordinating effect this pattern of
      goal-relations and expectations might have had is trumped by Hendriks control
      over Archs actions. Archs lack of freedom is an unfavourable circumstance, that
      is, one in which the coordinating role of shared goals may be blocked. Another
      unfavourable circumstance is antagonism to plural activity. Suppose that Ella and
      Cohen have been tasked with wiping a table clean. Ella is desperate to clean the
      table without Cohen, and Cohen is desperate to clean it without Ella. Neither
      thinks this will be possible, and they satisfy (a)-(d) above. But because they
      are desperate to act alone, each tries to sabotage the others efforts. Any
      coordinating effect the shared goal might have had is overridden by the agents
      antagonism to plural activity. In short, then, favourable circumstances are those
      in which factors that would defeat the coordinating tendency of the pattern of
      goal-relations and expectations in (a)-(d) are absent; paradigm defeating factors
      are a lack of freedom and antagonism towards plural activity. <a id="x1-8004r8"

      <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">8.</span> <a id="x1-90008" name=
      "x1-90008"></a>Shared goals characterise one form of joint action</h3>
      <!--l. 279-->

      <p class="noindent">So far I have stipulated that the function of shared goals is
      to coordinate plural activities and argued that this function could be realised
      by a certain pattern of goal-relations and expectations. Finally I shall use this
      to characterise a form of joint action which, lacking the cognitive and
      conceptual demands associated with shared intentional action, could be used to
      explicate the premise that engaging in joint action fosters an understanding of
      minds.</p><!--l. 281-->

      <p class="indent">Shared goals are characteristic of a form of joint action but
      the relation between possession of a shared goal and performing a joint action is
      not straightforward. Compare ordinary individual action. Acting intentionally is
      not just a matter of acting and simultaneously intending; nor is it even just a
      matter of being caused to act by an intention (<a href=
      "#Xen_1211">Searle</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1211">1983</a>, pp.&nbsp;136-7).
      Relatedly, we should not suppose that the mere presence, or even the mere
      efficacy, of a shared goal is sufficient for joint action. Take any collection of
      actions directed to a single goal, G, involving two or more agents. Let us say
      that these actions, taken collectively, are <span class="cmti-12">driven by a
      shared goal</span> when G is a shared goal of the agents, when, in performing
      actions directed to this goal, they are acting on the associated expectations and
      any other attitudes in ways that are rational, and when their so acting functions
      to coordinate their actions in a way that would normally facilitate the goals
      occurring as a common effect of all their efforts. (I assume that, although the
      expectations mentioned in Section 7 may not be necessary for possessing a shared
      goal, some such expectations are always involved.) I claim that actions driven by
      shared goals are joint actions.</p><!--l. 283-->

      <p class="indent">Why accept this? Recall the six indicators of joint action
      identified earlier (Section 4). Where these three conditions hold of an
      interaction, most of these indicators will be present. The interaction will be
      distinct from a case in which the agents pursue the goal in parallel and without
      a shared goal (this was the second indicator). The action will be voluntary with
      respect to its jointness insofar as jointness is partly due to agents acting on
      their expectations in ways that are rational, as contrasted with interactions
      where coordination involves only involuntary forms of emergent coordination
      (third indicator). If the goal occurs, this will normally be in part because of
      the coordination provided by the shared goal; in this sense, the coordination
      serves to direct the agents actions, taken together, to the goal and this amounts
      to more than each agents actions being individually directed to the goal (fourth
      indicator). Finally, the agents dispositions to adapt their actions to each
      others is built into the requirement that the shared goal function to coordinate
      their actions by means of their acting on the associated expectations (sixth
      indicator). In short, actions driven by shared goals have many features
      indicative of joint action. This is reason to hold that they are in fact joint
      actions.</p><!--l. 285-->

      <p class="indent">Not every case in which actions are driven by shared goals fits
      intuitively with paradigm examples of joint action. Consider two drivers on a
      collision course in a narrow street. Suppose (perhaps unrealistically) that each
      acts with the goal of avoiding a collision between their cars, expects the other
      to do the same and expects that they will avoid collision thanks to their
      combined efforts. This is sufficient for avoiding a collision to be a shared
      goal. (Note that specifying the goal requires care: the drivers actions would
      have different goals if, for instance, the only goal of each drivers action were
      to avoid hitting the other.) Suppose also that their actions are driven by a
      shared goal in the sense defined above. So, on the above account, their avoiding
      collision is a joint action. (Not all cases of avoiding a collision are joint
      actions, only those, if any, which are driven by shared goals.) But intuitively
      this case may not seem to fit with paradigms of joint action because the
      interaction is so minor. If this counts as joint action, then, given the right
      goal-relations and expectations, so could passing someone in a corridor. Should
      we modify the account of joint action in order to exclude this sort of case?
      There is an obstacle to doing that. We could elaborate a series of interactions
      driven by the shared goal of avoiding collision where each interaction is
      slightly less minor than its predecessor in the series. Whether or not intuitions
      support drawing a boundary, it seems that no such boundary is theoretically
      significant for understanding the role of joint action in development. Since our
      aim is to characterise joint action as it fosters development, we should risk
      deviating from intuition to avoid otherwise unnecessary complexity.</p>
      <!--l. 287-->

      <p class="indent">There is another sort of case in which actions driven by a
      shared goal may not intuitively fit with paradigm joint actions. Consider again
      the two drivers whose goal is to avoid collision. Now suppose, in addition, that
      the first driver hawkishly accelerates while covertly preparing to brake if
      necessary, causing the second driver to brake hard. Given the present account,
      their actions nevertheless constitute joint action. This may not fit intuitively
      with paradigm joint actions because the first driver dominates the second (and
      does so by means of deception).<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn15x0" id=
      "fn15x0-bk" name="fn15x0-bk"><sup class=
      "textsuperscript">15</sup></a></span><a id="x1-9001f15" name="x1-9001f15"></a>
      Again it is possible to elaborate a series of cases involving gradually varying
      degrees of domination. While outright coercion is incompatible with joint action
      on the account I have offered (see Section 7 above), neither domination nor other
      failures to be cooperative are excluded. This may conflict with intuitions about
      joint action but reduces the complexity of the account. That the account is
      nevertheless an account of joint action is shown by the presence of the other
      indicators of joint action mentioned above.</p><!--l. 289-->

      <p class="indent">Accounts of joint action sometimes invoke special kinds of
      mental state (<a href="#Xen_1426">Gilbert</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1426">1992</a>;&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1369">Searle</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1369">2002</a>), special kinds of reasoning (<a href="#Xen_1383">Gold &amp;
      Sugden</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1383">2007a</a>), special kinds of interdependence
      (<a href="#Xen_1356">Bratman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1356">1993</a>;&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1827">Miller</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1827">2001</a>) or, apparently, special
      kinds of agent (<a href="#Xen_2391">Helm</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_2391">2008</a>).
      The present account, if successful, shows that there is a simple kind of joint
      action characterising which requires no such special ingredients. The simple kind
      of joint action involves only ordinary individual goal directed-actions being
      coordinated in part by expectations about others goal-directed actions and their
      common effects.</p><!--l. 291-->

      <p class="indent">There are, of course, questions and puzzles about joint action
      which the simple account offered here does not address and which may call for
      greater complexity. These include issues about commitment (<a href=
      "#Xen_1287">Gilbert</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1287">2006</a>), the coordination of
      decisions to act jointly (<a href="#Xen_1297">Velleman</a>&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1297">1997</a>), the kind of reasoning needed for coordinating choices
      (<a href="#Xen_1373">Sugden</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1373">2000</a>), and the
      possibilities of intending others actions (<a href=
      "#Xen_1369">Searle</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1369">2002</a>,&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1692">1994</a>) and of acting on others intentions (<a href=
      "#Xen_1427">Roth</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1427">2004</a>). Failure to address these
      questions or tackle these puzzles might be an objection if the simple account
      were meant to be the whole story about joint action. In fact the simple account
      is not supposed to apply to every case of joint action. For instance, painting a
      house together will probably involve intentionally coordinating plans and so
      require sharing intentions rather than merely sharing goals. On the other hand,
      in some cases joint action does not require planning, commitment, coordinating
      decisions to act or special kinds of reasoning. Knoblich and Sebanz offer an
      example:</p>

      <div class="quote">
        <!--l. 294-->

        <p class="noindent">the way people lift a two-handled basket depends on whether
        they lift it alone or together. When alone, a person would normally grasp each
        handle with one hand. When together, one person would normally grasp the left
        handle with his/her right hand and the other person would grasp the right
        handle with his/her left hand. (<a href="#Xen_1429">Knoblich &amp;
        Sebanz</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1429">2008</a>, p.&nbsp;2026)</p>
      </div><!--l. 297-->

      <p class="noindent">Because handles provide an obvious way for two people to lift
      the basket (these authors even postulate a joint affordance) and people are often
      skilled at coordinated lifting, planning is typically unnecessary and it is
      plausible that shared goals are sufficient for joint actions of this
      sort.<span class="footnote-mark"><a href="#fn16x0" id="fn16x0-bk" name=
      "fn16x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">16</sup></a></span><a id="x1-9002f16"

      "x1-100009"></a>Conclusion</h3><!--l. 303-->

      <p class="noindent">The question was this. Given the premise that joint action
      plays some role in explaining how children come to understand minds, what could
      joint action be? The negative point was that it couldnt involve sharing
      intentions for reasons connected to the fact that sharing intentions involves
      coordinating planning and so requires sophistication in ascribing propositional
      attitudes. The positive claim was that there is a simple account of joint action
      which is compatible with the developmental premise. On the simple account, joint
      action involves sharing goals and sharing goals requires only an understanding of
      goal-directed actions and their common effects.</p><!--l. 305-->

      <p class="indent">This simple account of joint action is not offered as a
      replacement for Bratman's account or any accounts competing with his. Bratman's
      account assumes that joint action involves shared intention where the functions
      of shared intention include coordinating paradigmatically long-term plans. Such
      an account may be required to characterise complex cases where success demands
      that agents plans mesh. But some cases of joint action (such as carrying a
      two-handled basket together) do not involve plans in the relevant sense of
      planning. The agents need to coordinate their activities but not their plans. The
      simple account applies only in such cases. In philosophical accounts of
      individual action, actions explainable by intending are sometimes distinguished
      from other kinds of individual action including response behaviours, arrational
      actions and merely purposive activities (<a href="#Xen_181">Dickinson &amp;
      Balleine</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_181">1993</a>;&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_1683">Hursthouse</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_1683">1991</a>;&nbsp;<a href=
      "#Xen_25">Velleman</a>&nbsp;<a href="#Xen_25">2000</a>). Comparable distinctions
      are certain to be needed for understanding joint action; the differences between
      shared intentions and shared goals mark one such distinction between kinds of
      joint action.</p>
