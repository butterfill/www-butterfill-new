  If acting together helps children learn about minds, what kind of joint action makes that possible?
  * The kind that involves shared intention demands the very mindreading skills we’re trying to explain.
  * A simpler kind: joint action with **shared goals**, where each expects the other’s goal-directed actions to result in a common effect.
  * There are at least two kinds of joint action: planning-based (shared intentions) and minimal (shared goals).
