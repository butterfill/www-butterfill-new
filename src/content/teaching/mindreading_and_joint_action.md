abstract: This course will introduce a variety of new and established
  philosophical ideas that might usefully inform experimental research on
  mindreading or on joint action (or both) but have so far been neglected or
  misunderstood by cognitive scientists. Starting from foundational questions
  like <i>What is a mental state?</i> and <i>Which events are actions?</i> we
  shall search for tools that might help us with two tasks. First, we need
  theoretically coherent and empirically motivated ways of distinguishing kinds
  of mindreading, and kinds of joint action. Second, we need ways of decomposing
  mindreading in something like the way that actual reading can be decomposed
  into orthographic, lexical, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic components.
