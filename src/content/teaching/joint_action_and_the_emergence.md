abstract: "How can we explain the emergence, in evolution or development, of
  mindreading? Some conjecture that its emergence involves joint action
  (Knoblich & Sebanz, 2006; Moll & Tomasello, 2007). Reflection on objections to
  this conjecture reveals mistakes in leading philosophical accounts of both
  mindreading and joint action. These lectures aim to identify the mistakes and
  provide fixes. The fixes involve two steps: the construction of a minimal
  theory of mind; and an account of the distinct roles for shared intention and
  social motor representation in explaining what joint action is."
