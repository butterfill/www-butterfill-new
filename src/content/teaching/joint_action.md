abstract: |
  Joint action is a familiar feature of everyday life: people move tables together,
  walk together, play piano duets and cooperatively rear babies. For social (and
  eusocial) animals, effective joint action is necessary for survival. It also arguably
  explains the emergence, in evolution or development, of sophisticated cognitive
  capacities. Yet, as we will see, philosophers currently struggle to answer even the most basic
  questions about joint action.
