abstract: |
  This is an unorthodox introduction to Descartes’ *Meditations* for undergraduates. 
  Descartes apologised twice, in writing for the poor quality of his arguments against
  scepticism. 
  Looking at the *Meditations* in the context of Descartes’ other writing,
  particularly his unpublished manuscript *The World*,  
  reveals Descartes was interested in something
  much deeper and more interesting than the contemporary concerns with epistemology
  that have been pinned on him.
