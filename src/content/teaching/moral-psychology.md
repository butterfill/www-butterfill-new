  Humans have ethical abilities--abilities to act in accordance with ethical considerations, to make ethical judgements, to exercise moral suasion, and to feel things in response to unethical or superordinate acts. Moral psychology is the study of the psychological aspects of these ethical abilities. The questions for this course are: What ethical abilities do humans have? What states and processes underpin them? What, if anything, do discoveries about ethical abilities imply for political conflict, and what do they imply about ethics?
