## Abstract

This talk introduces a series of hypotheses and claims about the systems and models involved in mindreading (or ‘theory of mind’), explains how they generate predictions by drawing a parallel with cognition of physical properties like momentum, and highlights some recent evidence indicating that some of the hypotheses may be correct.
