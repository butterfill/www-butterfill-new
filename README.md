## üìù Content Management

### Using the Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains tools for importing and managing academic content:

#### 1. BibTeX Content Sync (`sync-bibtex.mjs`)

You can create the entries in writing manually, but if you already have them as bibtex
then this script will import them for you:

```bash
cd scripts
node sync-bibtex.mjs path/to/your/bibliography.bib
```

This script:
- Parses BibTeX entries
- Creates markdown files in `src/content/writing/`
- Extracts metadata (title, authors, year, journal, etc.)

#### 2. BibTeX Filtering (`bib-filter.js`)

*You don't need to use this directly as it‚Äôs called by `sync-bibtex.mjs`. 

Filters BibTeX files by author name:

```bash
cd scripts
node bib-filter.js input.bib --keyword "your-name" > filtered.bib
```

Options:
- `--keyword, -k`: Author name to filter by (default: "butterfill")
- Automatically excludes conference abstracts and thesis entries
- Filters out entries with "submitted", "progress", or "preparation" in year field

#### 3. LLM Content Generation (`generate-llms.mjs`)

Creates a consolidated text file for LLM consumption:

```bash
node scripts/generate-llms.mjs
```

This generates `public/llms.txt` containing all publications and talks in a format optimized for Large Language Models.

### Adding New Content

#### Publications

1. **Manual approach:** Create markdown files in `src/content/writing/`
2. **BibTeX approach:** Use `sync-bibtex.mjs` to import from bibliography files

#### Adding full text to publications

1. Add the full text as html in `<div class="fulltext"></div>` in the `article.md` file.

2. Add markdown to `public/md`. Make sure the md has the same basename as the article. The build script will find the markdown file. 

Where a markdown file exists, `Copy for Chat` (with LLMs) will be enabled. [‚àûtodo: also add link to full text in the `LLMS.txt` file]

#### Adding pdfs to publications

Add the pdf to `public/pdf` and update the `pdfUrl` property [‚àûtodo: auto match pdfs to filenames]. Make sure the pdf has the same basename as the article.


#### Talks

1. Create markdown files in `src/content/talks/YYYY/` (organized by year)
2. Add slide images to `public/img/talks/talk-name/`
3. Include `slideImages` array in frontmatter for interactive presentations

#### Teaching Materials

Create markdown files in `src/content/teaching/` for course materials and lectures.


### Interactive Slide Presentations

Talks can include interactive slide presentations using Reveal.js:

```markdown
---
title: "My Talk"
slideImages:
  - /img/talks/my-talk/slide-000.jpg
  - /img/talks/my-talk/slide-001.jpg
---
```


## üèóÔ∏è Building and Deployment

### Local Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command:
1. Runs `generate-llms.mjs` to create the LLM content file
2. Builds the static site to `./dist/`

### Preview Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

Preview the built site locally before deployment.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloudflare Pages Deployment

This site is optimized for deployment on Cloudflare Pages.

### Automatic Deployment

1. **Connect your repository** to Cloudflare Pages
2. **Configure build settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `dist`
   - Node.js version: 18+

3. **Environment variables** (if needed):
   - No special environment variables required for basic deployment

### Manual Deployment

1. **Build the site:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Cloudflare Pages:**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler pages deploy dist
   ```

### Redirects

The site includes redirect rules in `public/_redirects` for maintaining backward compatibility with old URL structures. These are automatically handled by Cloudflare Pages.

You probably do not want these as they‚Äôre specific to my old site.


### Content Collections

Content is managed using Astro's content collections:
- `writing`: Academic publications
- `talks`: Conference presentations
- `teaching`: Educational materials
